      "message": "What I wrote was wrong for all negative numbers, but it was attempting to be right for -1\u003c\u003c63, which this code is not. I think if you replace these three lines in your new version with \n\nm2 :\u003d uint64(t.ext)\nsign :\u003d byte(\u0027+\u0027)\nif t.ext \u003c 0 {\n\nthen everything will be OK. Note the uint64 conversion on the first line. Please also add a test for mono\u003d-1\u003c\u003c63. Thanks.",
