      "message": "FYI I plan to land this for 1.19 because I think it\u0027s too big/unsafe of a fix for 1.18.\n\nhowever, I will consider sending out another change that is simpler and safer to backport, which ensures monotonicity just before metrics are published. I\u0027m only considering it because as of now, this is pretty much worked around upstream where necessary already. *shrug*",
