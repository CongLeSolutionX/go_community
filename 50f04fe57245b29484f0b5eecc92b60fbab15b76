      "message": "As far as I can tell, this is needed to implement #cgo_import_dynamic on ELF systems when using internal linking.  It\u0027s entirely possible that we never test that case.  I have no idea why it is currently only implemented for amd64.  It looks like it might date back to a bad edit of 8l/asm.c in https://golang.org/cl/3491042.",

      "message": "Ah, I think you are right (if you are, this will break the build on solaris, which appears to be only use of cgo_import_dynamic in the tree -- which also might be why it is only supported on amd64, as IIRC that\u0027s the only arch that go supports solaris on).\n\nI guess it would be OK to just add s.Dynimplib to the dynlib list here?  But maybe it\u0027s best to leave this for after 1.5.",
