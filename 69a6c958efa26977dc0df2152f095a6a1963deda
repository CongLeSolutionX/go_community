      "message": "I\u0027m reluctant to do that, unless these changes are guaranteed to land early in the next cycle (this change is part of a stack that got blocked on CL#342510) - currently, CL#348733 which the referenced change depends on, is still not approved.\n\nOverall, the conflicts will be fairly minor and easy to resolve (additional symbols in objabi/reloctype.go and additional cases for r.Type handling in mips64/asm.go).\nIf the referenced stack becomes ready to land, I can easily rebase, otherwise I\u0027d like to not be unnecessarily blocked (an alternative would be to pull the combined additional reloc types into a separate CL that we then both rebase on to).",
