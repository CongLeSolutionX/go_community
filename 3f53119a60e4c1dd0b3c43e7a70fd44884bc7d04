This document specifies how a \u003czone_id\u003e can be appended to the\n   address.  According to URI syntax [RFC3986], \"%\" is always treated as\n   an escape character in a URI, so, according to the established URI\n   syntax [RFC3986] any occurrences of literal \"%\" symbols in a URI MUST\n   be percent-encoded and represented in the form \"%25\".  Thus, the\n   scoped address fe80::a%en1 would appear in a URI as\n   http://[fe80::a%25en1].",
