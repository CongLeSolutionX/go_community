      "message": "Yes, I will this to `vertical-lr`. I found something interesting... Chrome (and the majority of browsers) actually don\u0027t support `sideways-*` - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/writing-mode. I believe it was working before by calling `rotate` in the CSS. The behavior of `vertical-lr` and `vertical-rl` are slightly different than `sideways-*`. There is no option to get the text in the same exact orientation it was previously that I could find... I think the closest is with \u0027vertical-lr`. Let me know if this a blocker. If it is, I think the alternative would be going back to playing with some different `rotate` calls, etc here. Also more than happy to follow up with another CL for it at some point. Let me know!",
