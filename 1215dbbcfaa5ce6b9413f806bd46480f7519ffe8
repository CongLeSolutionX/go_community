      "message": "You could change the slices package to use constraint type literals with interfaces for now, then you are not blocked by the parser/type checker.\n\nThe api tool should print constraints always the same: ~T and interface{~T} are the same and simply changing the notation in the source is not a breaking API change. The api tool can either print such interfaces as they are presented by go/types (which implicitly wraps interfaces around these constraints). Alternatively, the API tool could recognize interfaces with exactly one embedded non-method element and then just print that element. Outside constraint position that element must be an embedded interface, so that will be correct everywhere. This is slightly more complicated \u0027if\u0027 but may make for more readable api tool output.\n\nIf the api tool output is stable with respect to such source changes, you can then update the slices package to the more compact representation when all tools are ready and the api tool output shouldn\u0027t change.",
