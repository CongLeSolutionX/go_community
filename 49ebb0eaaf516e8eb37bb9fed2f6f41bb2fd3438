Otherwise, please address any problems and update the GitHub PR. When complete, mark this comment as \u0027Done\u0027 and click the [blue \u0027Reply\u0027 button](https://go.dev/wiki/GerritBot#i-left-a-reply-to-a-comment-in-gerrit-but-no-one-but-me-can-see-it) above.\n\nPossible problems detected:\n  1. You usually need to reference a bug number for all but trivial or cosmetic fixes. For this repo, the format is usually \u0027Fixes #12345\u0027 or \u0027Updates #12345\u0027 at the end of the commit message. Should you have a bug reference?\n\nThe commit title and commit message body come from the GitHub PR title and description, and must be edited in the GitHub web interface (not via git). For instructions, see [here](https://go.dev/wiki/GerritBot/#how-does-gerritbot-determine-the-final-commit-message). For guidelines on commit messages for the Go project, see [here](https://go.dev/doc/contribute#commit_messages).\n\n\n(In general for Gerrit code reviews, the change author is expected to [log in to Gerrit](https://go-review.googlesource.com/login/) with a Gmail or other Google account and then close out each piece of feedback by marking it as \u0027Done\u0027 if implemented as suggested or otherwise reply to each review comment.

      "message": "It\u0027s not clear to me the benefit of this. Some of the reflect.Value methods have been carefully written to be inlineable, while reflect.Value.IsZero is too complex to inline. This means we\u0027re now going through an extra method call.\n\nHave we benchmarked the impact of this on a struct with `omitempty` applied on many fields of the type captured in the modified case statements?",
