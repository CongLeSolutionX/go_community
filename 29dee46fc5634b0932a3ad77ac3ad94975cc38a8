      "message": "This is not true. This is the estimated _maximum_ CPU time used by this process. It is ∫gomaxprocs dt, which is a massive overestimate for processes with idles Ps.\n\nI\u0027d expect a metric with this name to be the sum of time spent in _Prunning, and ∫gomaxprocs dt to be something like /cpu/classes/total-available:cpu-seconds.\n\n(These metrics are clearly focused on the GC, where I agree that this metric makes sense as this is what GC CPU targets are based on, but I think that most users coming here looking for general CPU metrics (not necessarily GC-specific) will not expect this.)",
