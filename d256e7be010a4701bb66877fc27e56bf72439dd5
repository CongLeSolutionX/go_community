And having that implementation detail here doesn\u0027t save us from going to the `Regexp.Expand` and reading more detailed information there.\n\nTo me, the original text isn\u0027t too descriptive about the $ sign, and it seems like a leaked implementation detail of the underneath method.\n\nLet\u0027s do one more round of thinking and if you would still think the original text is better I\u0027ll bring it back.",
