      "message": "Traditionally, -o names the file that is consumed by the linker (because traditionally there\u0027s no object file consumed by the compiler). That way, if a -o is specified, it keeps the meaning as before, even if there\u0027s a compiler-specific object as well. As it is, I am guessing that in all places where we also specify a compiler object, we need to swap the filenames that go with -o and -linkobj. What am I missing?\n\n(So I would have expected the flag to be called, -export[obj], -api, -pkgobj, or some such, with the meaning of -o as is but for compiler info stripped.)",
