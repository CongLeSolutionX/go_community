      "message": "I\u0027m 99.9% sure you can\u0027t get the system roots on a non-jailbroken iOS device.\n\nOne kinda lousy option is to include all known iOS system roots in the x509 package itself (e.g. from http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT5012), and then use SecTrustEvaluate to check each of them at startup to ensure that they are still trusted by the actual running OS.\n\nAnother--even worse--option is to provide a code path that passes through to SecTrustEvaluate on an as-needed basis.\n\nIn the meantime, though, it may be better to have x509 build with an empty set of roots than to have it not build at all.",

      "message": "This will break down if the developer has multiple copies of Xcode installed, which is common during iOS beta periods.
