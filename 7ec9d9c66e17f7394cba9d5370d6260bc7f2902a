      "message": "Mr. Pratt, \n\nSorry to bother you with this review, but I had significant difficulty squaring statements in `abi-internal.md` and the BUGS sections of sync/atomic and thought that this documentation change may help others who were confused like me. If you think that something like this fix is useful, please let me know and I will gladly modify the language however you think is best!\n\nThank you!\nWill",

As an alternative, perhaps we could say something like:\n\n\"The first word in an allocated struct, array, or slice, in a global variable, or in a local variable (because atomic ops will cause an escape to the heap) can be relied upon to be 64-bit aligned.\"",

      "message": "Hello!\n\nFirst, I apologize for my delay! \n\nSecond, thank you for so seriously engaging with me about this minor change. The discrepancy between what is started in the `sync/atomic` documentation and what is said in the `abi-internal.md` caused me no end of heartburn on Friday. I just could not reconcile the conflicting statements until I dug back through the commit log and realized the hidden assumption I was missing.\n\nThat said, you are *absolutely* correct and I thought the same thing as soon as I clicked submit. I think that your proposal is a great compromise. I will resubmit with that language and then you can let me know what you think.\n\nThank you again for the honest, sincere feedback and engagement!\nWill",
