      "message": "This loop can take a non-trivial amount of time for largish values of GOMAXPROCS. Local timers could expire while these loops run. Consider adding a call to checkTimers somewhere in these loops to avoid the expense of stealing G\u0027s or timers from other P\u0027s when a local timer expires and would schedule a G while we\u0027re spinning.\n\nIt seems reasonable to me to prefer scheduling a G from local timers over stealing work or timers from other Ps because it avoids costly locking and queue churn.\n\nI believe this addition would help resolve the issue described in #28808.",
