      "message": "Here\u0027s my take on how to export and import type-switch statements.  I\u0027m not planning to do the extra work to allow actual inlining of function with OTYPESW, but let me know if you think otherwise.  So, this export/import functionality is mainly for the upcoming generics work.  (But for OCLOSURE, in a separate change, I am trying to support inlining, so it\u0027s more work.)\n\nDefinitely let me know any comments, whether about the overall approach or small details or anything I missed.  Thanks!\n",
