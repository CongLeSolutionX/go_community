      "message": "I really like the `cgoAvailable` in your CL, it makes it much more clear and simpler. I think that this CL (mine) would be much simpler to understand if I would have added the `cgoAvailable`and same as you made the netgo/netcgo build tags as constant and then in the initConfVal converted them to the confVal.resolver.\n\nI will give this a try and will see.\n\n\u003e  Do you see any problems there?\n\nI don\u0027t feel like it really simplifies the cgo/go selection. I mean it is still really easy to make an unnoticeable mistake there.",
