ResponseRecorder is a recording, it logs what happened for future examination.\n\nPerhaps something like this instead?\n\n```\ntype ResponseCodeHeader struct {\n  Code   int\n  Header http.Header\n}\n\ntype ResponseRecorder struct {\n  // Code1xxs is a list of 1xx response headers written by a handler.\n  Code1xxs []ResponseCodeHeader\n}\n```\n\n(I don\u0027t particularly like the name `ResponseCodeHeader`, but I\u0027m not coming up with a better one at the moment.)",
