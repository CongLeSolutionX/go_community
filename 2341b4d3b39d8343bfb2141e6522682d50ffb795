      "message": "This looks like \"comparable\" is a defined term, but it is not. What that section says is that in any comparison of x and y, x must be assignable to y, or vice versa. There is a defined term \"comparable\" but it applies to a single type, indicating whether that values of that type can be compared. It is not a relation on pairs of types.\n\nIt is true that a case expression is valid if and only if you can use it in a comparison against the type of the switch expression; it\u0027s just misleading or confusing to hyperlink the word comparable here.\n\nI suggest letting this paragraph be about the type of the switch expression only, so delete this first sentence. Then the section that discusses the type of the case expressions can also mention the restriction on those types.\n\nActually, it looks like there is no paragraph that explains the type of a case expression. That paragraph should be added, and then what I said before makes more sense. :-)\n\nIn particular there doesn\u0027t seem to be anything (in this section at least) that explains that in\n\n    var f float64\n    switch f {\n    case 1: \n    }\n\nthe value 1 in the case has type float64.",
