      "message": "Hmm, how about just allowing type parameters if built against go1.18?\n\nI have two concerns with leaving the flag:\n + The sense of the flag is probably wrong.  In the future, we may want to _disallow_ type parameters, but not explicitly allow them.\n + I don\u0027t like leaving the flag with a comment to remove it before 1.17 is cut, concerned that I might forget.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are OK with actually shipping go1.17 with this flag, then it would be simpler to leave it (along with a warning that it is not a stable API and will be removed in the future when type parameters are enabled by default, of course).\n\nWDYT?",
