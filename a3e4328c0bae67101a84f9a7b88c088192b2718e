      "message": "This optimization is a bit similar to shortcircuitï¼Œbecause they deal with the derivable branches in the same way (by redirection), but they are for different cases. shortcircuit requires the control value to be OpPhi, and this code does not require the control value to be a specific Op, it can be phi, or Less, leq, etc. This optimization also can\u0027t handle the cases handled by shortcircuit, so they cannot be merged.",
