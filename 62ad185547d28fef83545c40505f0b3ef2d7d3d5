CL 126316 introduced an function avoidFunctions to skip the functions that we don\u0027t want to appear in CPU profile of gccgo. But gccgo has done this point with another way, so this function is nolonger needed. If we don\u0027t remove this function, a few gccgo tests will fail.",

After porting this CL to gofrontend(https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/gofrontend/+/229337), these tests passed in gollvm, and it does not affect their passing in gccgo. I don\u0027t know why these tests pass in gccgo, but they do pass.\n\nThere are also two failed tests in the runtime/pprof package of gccgo. They are TestConvertMemProfile and TestConvertMemProfile .
