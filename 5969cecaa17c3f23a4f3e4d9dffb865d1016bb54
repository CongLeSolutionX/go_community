Still not biting off the archive/zip work, since IIRC the symlink support in the format is a bit hacky.\n\nI would like someone with security expertise to look over the CopyFS implementation in particular. Off-hand, I am a bit concerned about something like CVE-2024-45845, but we may be trusting fs.FS implementations to not return duplicate entries.",
