So this condition may need to change to something like s.Sect !\u003d r.Sym.Sect in external linking. Also need to be sure that the trampoline and the caller are in the same section.",

If this is the case, using R31 should be fine, because we no longer need the external linker to create call stubs.\n\nIf R12 is needed in other cases, we probably have to use R12 then. Normally it is ok. For special cases like runtime.duffzero/duffcopy, we can tell the compiler that R12 will be clobbered. Is there any other case that CALL does not kill registers?\n\nI\u0027ll go read the ABI doc. But leave a comment first.",

Executables created by default with golang are not compiled for PIC (dynamic or static), and that is the reason this bug has happened, and that is the only case now where trampolines are being created.\n\nThe question is, is it ever possible to link a program where some Go code was compiled for PIC and some not.  I don\u0027t know if there is a situation where that could happen or if the linker tries to detect it.  To be safe R12 could be used here and then indicate R12 as clobbered for the duff devices calls.\n\nNote this does not affect C code because C code is always built with R12 and R2 set up.\n\nMy understanding is that the external linking can only create dynamic executables, and the internal linker must be used to create static executables on ppc64le.",
