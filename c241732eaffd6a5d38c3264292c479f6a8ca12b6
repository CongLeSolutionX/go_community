Following Jay\u0027s advice, it worked in the same way without any fuss.\n\nIn the latest patchset\n- Used `module.SplitPathVersion` in CreateModFile\n- Added new test cases for paths with a trailing dot\n- Added new test case for paths with spaces, so that we can also close #46085\n\nDo you have any other edge cases in mind that we should check?",
