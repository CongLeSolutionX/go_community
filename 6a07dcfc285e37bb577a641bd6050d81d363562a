      "message": "I would recommend trying non-recursive implementation, which could also be easier to be generalized to handle inverse FFT case. Some links for reference - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54319758/applying-fft-on-multiplication-of-two-very-large-number-without-using-recursion and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooleyâ€“Tukey_FFT_algorithm#Data_reordering,_bit_reversal,_and_in-place_algorithms\n\nThe reference code uses complex roots, but could be easily be adapted for prime fields.\n\nAlso worth a note that suggested implementation can work inplace and it is cache-friendly, because we always update adjacent coefficients",
