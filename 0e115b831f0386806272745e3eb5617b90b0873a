      "message": "Sorry for confusion, but I am not sure now that we should add tests containing \\ into jointest. New tests you have added (as per my suggestion) contradict what filepath.Clean does. filepath.Clean behaviour differs considerable between unix and windows.\n\nFor example this program http://play.golang.org/p/31r6-5pLHt prints\n\n\\\t-\u003e\t\\\n/\t-\u003e\t/\n/\\/\t-\u003e\t/\\\n/\\//a\t-\u003e\t/\\/a\n/\\/a\t-\u003e\t/\\/a\n\non unix, but\n\n\\       -\u003e      \\\n/       -\u003e      \\\n/\\/     -\u003e      \\\n/\\//a   -\u003e      \\a\n/\\/a    -\u003e      \\a\n\non windows.\n\nI don\u0027t think we should make filepath.Clean and filepath.Join behave differently. So, unless we agree that filepath.Clean treatment of \\ is broken, I suggest we should leave unix filepath.Join alone and just fix windows.\n\nIan, Dave. What do you think?",

      "message": "This might not be ideal for clean on unix but understandable:\n/\\/a\t-\u003e\t/\\/a\n\nBut passing in the below to join for unix just makes no sense:\n`\\`, `a` -\u003e  `/\\/a`\n\nThis is actually due to join adding extra slash which is the same issue as with UNC paths. I don\u0027t mind ignoring it and consider fixing it in another CL, if that is what every one else wants to do.",

      "message": "I considered fixing filepath.Clean in another CL. Unfortunately fileapth.Join implementation uses filepath.Clean. So we would have to fix filepath.Clean first. I am happy to do that, but I am not certain what the correct treatment of \\ on unix should be. So I would like input from someone who knows. Alternatively, like I said before, we could just leave non-windows code as is. I will wait some more.",
