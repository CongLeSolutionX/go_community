Maybe we could add new test in os/exec?\n\nMaybe create test child process that calls os.Environ and verifies that all variables are sorted.\n\nMaybe also add some variables (name starting with \"a\" or something) to the end of variable list before starting test child process and make sure the list is still sorted.",
