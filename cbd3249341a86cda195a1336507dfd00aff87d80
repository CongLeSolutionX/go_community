      "message": "If I\u0027m understanding correctly, wasm_pc_f_loop is always the \"top level\" entry point that ends up calling main.main, while wasm_pc_f_loop_until is used for other wasmexport functions.\n\n- Could we simplify by expressing wasm_pc_f_loop in terms of wasm_pc_f_loop_until, passing the PC of main.main? (potentially never reached since proc_exit would be called?)\n\n- If we keep both functions, maybe we could edit the names to better reflect the intent (e.g., wasm_pc_f_loop_main, wasm_pc_f_loop_export)?\n\nI don\u0027t hold strong opinions on either; I just wanted to bring it up in case we think these could be useful changes to make.",

      "message": "\u003e Could we simplify by expressing wasm_pc_f_loop in terms of wasm_pc_f_loop_until,\n\nMaybe. I could pass a nonexistent PC to simulate wasm_pc_f_loop. But then we always need an extra comparison which is not needed for the non-export case. Not sure if that performance matters, but it complicates the code (has to load the PC twice).\n\nI can rename them.",
