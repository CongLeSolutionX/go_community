      "message": "There is already a fairly robust module proxy in src/cmd/go/proxy_test.go, serving contents from src/cmd/go/testdata/mod.\n\nIs it possible to express the cases you want to test here as script tests in src/cmd/go/testdata/script?\n(If not, perhaps you could change the server in src/cmd/go/proxy_test.go to look for a .zip file in the archive before constructing its own?)\nThat seems like it would not only cut down on redundant infrastructure, but also emphasize the user-visible effects of the bug.",
