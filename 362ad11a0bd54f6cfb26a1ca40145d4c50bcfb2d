It looks like this was waiting for a +2 from Dmitry and the tree to open up, both of which have happened since some time ago.\n\nIt looks like this will need to be rebased with some merge conflict resolved.\n\nAustin, I\u0027ll leave it to you to either submit if you think now is okay (and the merge conflict is resolved this week), otherwise please add wait-release here, move issue #37355 to Go1.17 milestone and add early-in-cycle label so we don\u0027t miss it again.",
