Points I was trying to convey:\n - if *os.File, connected directly to corresponding field; no special goroutine is used.\n - if otherwise not nil, the goroutine is started to perform the copies.\n - if goroutine is created, Wait *will* wait for it to complete (os/exec/exec.go:461 waits on all its managed goroutines\u0027 error channels).",
