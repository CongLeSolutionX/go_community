      "message": "And this is a little misleading, since there\u0027s only one type of HTTP/2 upgrade request (this string) and it almost implies there\u0027s a change to our HTTP/2 support, which isn\u0027t true.\n\nI might replace this whole bullet with:\n\nThe server implementation is now stricter about rejecting requests with invalid HTTP versions. Invalid requests claiming to be HTTP/0.x are now rejected (HTTP/0.9 was never fully supported), and plaintext HTTP/2 requests other than the \"PRI * HTTP/2.0\" upgrade request are now rejected as well. The server continues to handle encrypted HTTP/2 requests.",
