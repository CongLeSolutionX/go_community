      "message": "This is one of my first more \u0027complete\u0027 features for Go, so I\u0027m looking for your input on this PoC eg. if you think of a better way to achieve this.\n\nSome the questions/issues currently\n\n- There is a cyclical dependency between the `math/rand` and `testing` packages.\nI\u0027m thinking there are three solutions, but I\u0027m not sure which would be preferred.\na) use some other method to seed and shuffle the slices. Maybe use runtime.fastrand and a new shuffling function?\nb) //go:linkname the `rand.Seed` and `rand.Shuffle` functions so that they can be used here\nc) move the `math/rand` tests in a `rand_testing` package; this entails duplication of variables and making the tests less readable\n\n- I haven\u0027t used the JSON output very extensively, so I don\u0027t know if it would make sense to introduce a new Action in `test2json` for setting the seed\n\n- Are we okay with `-shuffle\u003don` using the system clock for seeding, or should we use a shorter/more readable seed?\n\n\nLooking forward to your input!\n",
