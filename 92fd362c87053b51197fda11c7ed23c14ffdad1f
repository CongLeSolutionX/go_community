However, as I tested this feature, a single definitely of a `TestMain` is valid for the entire package under test and not just the particular file. I am submitting only because the difference confused *me* at least. That said, if my supposition is incorrect, then I am just really confused and please forgive me.\n\nThanks, as always, for everything!\nWill",
