      "message": "Note that we also ignore the error from getsockname in (*netFD).accept, newFileFD, (*netFD).listenStream, and (*netFD).listenDatagram.\n\nAs far as I can tell ignoring the error from getsockname dates back to commit 5d2ee9d90afc8277d20a1f40056caa047fae695b from before the open source release.  That was when the use of Getsockname was introduced.  So ever since the start we have always treated Getsockname as optional, and used an empty address when it failed.\n\nThe trybot failure suggests that this may be a reasonable choice: that there are some odd cases where it may fail.",
