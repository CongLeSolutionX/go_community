      "message": "FWIW, I think enumerating conflicts is useful, to encourage the author to document how they resolved them. But listing merged CLs like this seems like noise to me. Gerrit already provides this list to reviewers; \"git log\" will list merged CLs anyway when looking at history; \"git log commit^1..commit^2\" can always be used to list just the commits included in a merge.\n\nJust my 2c though.",
