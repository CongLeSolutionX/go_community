iOS
=======

To build a cross compiling toolchain for iOS on OS X, first modify clangwrap.sh
in misc/ios to match your setup. And then run:

	GOARM=7 CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=arm CC_FOR_TARGET=`pwd`/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh \
	CXX_FOR_TARGET=`pwd`/../misc/ios/clangwrap.sh ./make.bash

To build a program, use the normal go build command:

	CGO_ENABLED=1 GOARCH=arm go build import/path


Known issues
============
 - crypto/x509 won't build, I don't yet know how to get system root on iOS.
 - Because I still want to be able to do native build, CGO_ENABLED=1 is not the default, yet.
