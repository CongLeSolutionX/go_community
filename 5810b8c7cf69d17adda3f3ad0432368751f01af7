Perhaps you could write something like\n    if GOOS \u003d\u003d \"plan9\" {\n        if g :\u003d getg(); g \u003d\u003d g.m.gsignal {\n            // Use older, simpler code to avoid FP.\n            next :\u003d int32(fastrand1()) % (2 * int32(rate))\n            next -\u003d (int32(size) - c.next_sample)\n            if next \u003c 0 {\n                next \u003d 0\n            }\n            return next\n        }\n    }",
