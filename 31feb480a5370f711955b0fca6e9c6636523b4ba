      "message": "I\u0027ve rebased and updated the patch (to use zbb where possible) and re-run the benchmarks.  There have been some compiler changes that alter the results.  However, the B/s geomean improvement is 19% with the rva20u64 profile selected and 30% when building with rva22u64.  The best b/S improvement is about 47% with the Hash1M benchmark when building with rva22u64.  I also note that a handcoded assembly language version of MD5 for the Loongson architecture was recently merged, with a similar, although slightly larger, performance boost.",
