The current error message is better.\n  \nOr:\n\n  func(a int, string)\n  \nIn this case, the problem is a mix of styles; again the current message is better.\n\nI can\u0027t think of a wording that improves the message for \"func(a int, b)\" without hurting the cases above. (The type checker can obviously do better.)",
