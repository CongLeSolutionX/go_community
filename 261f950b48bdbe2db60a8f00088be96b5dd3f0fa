      "message": "\u003e func(int, int, int, int, a int, int int)\n\nthe error message for this is `int redeclared in this block`, as the first 4 `int` are treated as variables. The unnamed parameter could only happen at the last because `a,b, c int` will be recognized as a list of variables. So the first one doesn\u0027t apply to the case here.\n\nFor the second one, I agree with you that the real issue is caused by the mixing usage, and the \"variable declaration is incomplete\" only provides one of the possible fix, while we have 2 possible fixes:\n\n- remove the variable declaration: `func(int, string`\n- complete the function decl: `func(a int, b string)` or `func(a int, string []byte)`\n\n\nGiven the error case that all the parameters before are the named one and only the last one is unnamed, it\u0027s reasonable to expect it should be a named parameter as well.\n\nThe problem of the current message is it reports the position of the unnamed parameter, and under such case all the parameters before the position are named parameters. The position of `s` in `func(a int, string)` is mis-leading because we will only encounter this error when we first meet a unnamed parameter(all the parameters before will be recognized as named parameter even though it\u0027s not intended).\n\nBut generally, i think the `mixing` error is enough and usually this kind of error could be awared by users quickly. If you feel it\u0027s not an improvement, it\u0027s also fine to abandon this CL.\n\nBut anyway, thanks for your reviewing, i have learned a lot from you",

      "message": "\u003e the error message for this is int redeclared in this block\n\nSorry, in my haste I missed the comma between the last two \"int\"s. With it, the parser emits the \"mixed\" message.\n\n\n\u003e Given the error case that all the parameters before are the named one and only the last one is unnamed, it\u0027s reasonable to expect it should be a named parameter as well.\n\nI agree; and we could refine the existing error to \"unnamed parameter follows named paramter\" or somesuch, but it still wouldn\u0027t help us identify which part (name or type) is missing. If the type is a qualified identifier (e.g. io.Reader), then it\u0027s obviously a type; if it was a capitalized name, we might heuristically guess that it is a type, not a parameter name; but in the bug you actually encountered, the \"type\" was a lower case identifier, so neither of these refinements would have helped.\n\n\n\u003e But generally, i think the mixing error is enough and usually this kind of error could be awared by users quickly. If you feel it\u0027s not an improvement, it\u0027s also fine to abandon this CL.\n\nI haven\u0027t seen any approach yet that would be a real improvement yet here, so I am inclined to abandon it.\n\n\n\u003e But anyway, thanks for your reviewing, i have learned a lot from you\n\nYou\u0027re welcome.
