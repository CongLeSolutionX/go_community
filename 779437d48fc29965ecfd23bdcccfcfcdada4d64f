It doesn\u0027t conjure up ideas of a contiguous address region. It makes me think of an approximation to a quadratic or something.",

      "message": "linearAddress is not a virtual address, it\u0027s a virtual address with an offset. the intent is to view segmented address spaces (such as amd64\u0027s) as a contiguous space. there are a few places in the runtime where we want this view, and we just represent these addresses as uintptrs which is confusing and error-prone.\n\nI\u0027m certainly open to other terminology here, I agree \"linear\" is an overloaded term. here are some ideas: contigAddress? transformedAddress? rotatedAddress? offsetAddress (in terms of the verb \"offset\")?",
