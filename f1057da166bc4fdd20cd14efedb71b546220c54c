Keep in mind that TryBots currently test *exactly* your git commit, without rebasing. If your commit\u0027s git parent is old, the failure might\u0027ve already been fixed.\n\nHm, that failure looks like a nil pointer in the allgs list. Not sure what that might have to do with this CL, if anything. Time to trybot once more.\n",

      "message": "I think this should be called HasHeapPointers. *NotInHeapType is still a \"pointer\".\n\nAlso, I think it would be preferable to handle collapsing the variety of has-pointer functions in a followup, refactoring-only CL. There\u0027s so many mechanical renames that it took me a few passes before I was confident I\u0027d spotted all the normative changes. If splitting this out again is going to be a lot of work though, then don\u0027t worry about it.",
