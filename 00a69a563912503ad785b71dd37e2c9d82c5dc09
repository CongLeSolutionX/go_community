Is the following accurate?\n\n// We resolve package patterns by calling QueryPattern, which does not accept a\n// previous version and therefore cannot take it into account for the \"latest\" or\n// \"patch\" queries.\n// If we are resolving a package path or pattern, the caller has already resolved\n// any existing packages to their containing module(s), and will set both prevM.Version\n// and forceModulePath for those modules.\n// The only remaining package patterns are those that are not already provided by the\n// build list, which are indicated by an empty prevM.Version.",
