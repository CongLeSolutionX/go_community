No normal program should ever see this error, so there is no reason to export it.  The error exists to report buggy implementations of io.Writer.  I can\u0027t see any reason why a program would ever want to test whether it received an error reporting a buggy implementation of io.Writer.  I hope that the programmer would instead for the Write method so that the error stops occurring.",
