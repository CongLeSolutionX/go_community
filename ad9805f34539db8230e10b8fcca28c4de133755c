      "message": "This isn\u0027t quite right, semantically. The idea here is that in builtin/unsafe.go, there\u0027s\n\n    type Pointer uintptr\n\nand here we want to replace that TUINTPTR with TUNSAFEPTR.\n\nYour change here happens to work because we\u0027re already defining unsafe.Pointer as a TUNSAFEPTR type in universe.go:typeinit.  But the check is actually written to work even if unsafe.Pointer is currently a TFORW node.\n\nIf you want to proceed with this, I suggest just getting rid of \"type Pointer uintptr\" from builtin/unsafe.go (and replacing with a comment pointing to typeinit) and getting rid of this if conditional.",
