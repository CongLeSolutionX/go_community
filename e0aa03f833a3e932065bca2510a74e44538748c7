      "message": "Hmm, perhaps. I don\u0027t feel particularly strongly about this, but what rubs me the wrong way about showing runtime.goexit in this case is that it\u0027s entirely an implementation artifact. From a language perspective, the stack really is empty at this point. There\u0027s always a tension between how much we represent things from a language model perspective versus exposing the truth of the implementation because different people want different things. I guess we could do a dummy frame, \"(empty stack)\" or something, though dummy frames always feel a bit gross to me. That almost feels like something that should be done in the profile consumer?",
