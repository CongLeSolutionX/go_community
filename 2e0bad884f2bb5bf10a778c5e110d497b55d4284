There is nothing wrong with\n\n// this is a comment: //comment\n\n/*\nthis is a line comment: // line comment\n*/\n\nI think all you need to say is that the /* comment sequence is not recognized within a comment.

For example:\n\n    /* // */ foo\n\ncould arguably be both \"/* // */\" and \"// */ foo\" without nesting.",
