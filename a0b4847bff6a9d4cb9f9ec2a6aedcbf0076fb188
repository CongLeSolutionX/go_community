      "message": "Now I\u0027m realising that Struct and Field overlap. For example, in decode_test.go, you can see \"V\" and \"V.F2\".\n\nPerhaps we should leave Field intact, and instead have Struct contain the full path to the struct type. Then, in an input like:\n\n  {\n    \"S1\": {\n      \"S2\": {\n        \"F\": \"bad-type\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nYou would get Struct\u003d\u003d\"S1.S2\" and Field\u003d\u003d\"F\".\n\nAn alternative is to add a Prefix field, which would contain \"S1\". Then, the full path to the field would be Prefix+\".\"+Struct+\".\"+Field, ignoring leading dots. I\u0027d go with less fields, as long as changing the meaning of the Struct field is fine.\n\nAlso - note that either \"name of\" comment needs changing, if you\u0027re changing what\u0027s contained in the string.",
