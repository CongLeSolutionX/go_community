It says \"return some symbol with some name\" to me what decribes the mechanism not the purpose/semantics.\n\nI would have expected something like \"newIncompleteType\" or \"newUnresolvedType\" or \"newForwardReference\" or a bit more verbose \"newForwardReferenceToIncompleteType\". That would communicate the intent and may make the comments explaining this unnecessary/smaller.",
