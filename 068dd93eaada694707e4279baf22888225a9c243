      "message": "@dneil: I started on this to fix responses on invalid range request, but I realized the issue is much wider and it is about all errors returned from ServeContent API. This fix makes a list of common headers but maybe a better approach would be to simply wipe all pre-set headers before calling Error?\n\nAnyway, I am opening this to get feedback. I also have to add some tests but I am not sure how detailed should they be. Should I just make another test function to check if headers are removed on an error, or should I check response headers in all existing tests which return errors?",
