      "message": "It seems like the root of the problem here is that this code is sloppy about the postconditions of the `switch` statement: in some of the cases the `value` variable is always updated to the next chunk of the value to be parsed (even if an earlier chunk is invalid), and in other cases it is preserved as-is.\n\nThis would probably end up a lot clearer if we could fix that postcondition.\n\nEspecially given the length of the `switch` statement, perhaps it would make sense to factor it out into a standalone function? That would make it much easier to keep track of exactly when and under what conditions the `value` variable is updated.",
