      "message": "AttrSubSymbol means that the symbol appears on the Sub list of some other symbol.  Unfortunately, it\u0027s not 100% reliable; at least, it\u0027s not set correctly for the .TOC. symbol in Link.dodata.  Usually the Outer field of the symbol points to the symbol whose list it is on, but that it is not set for the symbols added to .windynamic in initdynimport in pe.go.\n\nThis seems to be used for host objects when doing internal linking.  The sections will get regular symbols.  The host symbols will be defined as SSUB symbols on the Sub linked list starting at the section symbol.  The blk function, which writes data to the file, will ignore SSUB symbols, and just write out host object sections as a unit.  There are various bits of code that loop through the Sub symbols when a symbol address is adjusted, adjusting all the Sub symbols as well.\n\nSo AttrSubSymbol should perhaps be something like AttrNonGoSym.\n\nSCONTAINER is only used in pclntab and findfunctab, and in effect it just marks host object section symbols.  It was introduced in https://golang.org/cl/11652 because the earlier test for host object section symbols--testing whether .Sub was nil was wrong (.Sub is not nil in symbols on a list, but it is nil for the last symbol).  It might make sense to replace this with a different attribute for host object section symbols.",
