      "message": "Ian is right.\n\nI\u0027ve heard at least a few people saying the phrase \"slice of gophers\" out loud in the last few months, no doubt as a consequence of the wiki entry. However, it was an option considered earlier too, including in Cassandra\u0027s 2017 Twitter poll (https://twitter.com/cass_ferrara/status/920836197513011202), and even earlier in 2016 (https://twitter.com/mdlayher/status/734853427738607616).\n\nMy personal favorite take is \"We\u0027re a slice of gophers when we\u0027re all together.\" from https://twitter.com/golangpher/status/734929153007472640.\n\nIn the end, all of those terms of venery were made up by people at one point or another, and so far no one has objected to this CL, so I think we\u0027re making history here. :)\n\nOf course, this is just a New Year\u0027s commit message and not to be taken too seriously.",
