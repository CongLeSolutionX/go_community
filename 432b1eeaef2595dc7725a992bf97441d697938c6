      "message": "Hi Michael, could you take a look at this CL of tests for the goroutine profiler please? It\u0027s a dependency of CL 387415, and is the source of some of the benchmark results I shared in that change\u0027s commit message.\n\nOnce this is ready, the whole stack should be good to merge. (I abandoned the two leaf-most changes, CL 387416 and CL 401336. They were relevant to the discussion but should not be merged, do not need review.) Thank you!",
