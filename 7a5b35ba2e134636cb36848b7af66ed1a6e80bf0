      "message": "An example with output will be run on all systems, including non-Unix systems.  Right now I think this example will cause a test failure on Windows systems, which is not OK.  Since it\u0027s probably hard to write an example that will run on both Windows and Unix, it would be better to write an example that doesn\u0027t use an Output line.\n\nThis problem is going to affect your other examples too.\n\nAlso in general this example should be simpler.  An example is not a test.  I\u0027m actually not sure how much it helps to have an example of IsAbs at all.",
