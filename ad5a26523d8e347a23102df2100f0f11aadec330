      "message": "This condition doesn\u0027t seem right to me. If `Lstat` returns `ErrNotExist`, that only tells us that `Mkdir` didn\u0027t create `path` — but that could be for any reason, not just “intermediate directory not found”! (For example, it could be due to a permission error, such as a read-only filesystem.)\n\nThe behavior reported in https://go.dev/issue/54040#issuecomment-1193780453 is that the `MkdirAll` call for a parent path (at line 43) succeeds but creates a directory with a different name from the one requested.\n\nSo it seems to me that in order to diagnose that problem, we should check for the existence of that parent path, not `path` itself — the error path being added here is not really any more informative than what we got from `Mkdir` already.\n\n(I\u0027ve added more detail on this topic in a comment on #54040, and I suggest we continue the conversation there until we have a clearer direction forward.)",
