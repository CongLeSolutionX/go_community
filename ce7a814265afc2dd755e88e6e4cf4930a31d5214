      "message": "Alas, that is too simple.  Those are the default default value uses.  But they aren\u0027t always the default values.  cmd/dist will look in its environment, when you build the toolchain, to pick up GO386 and GOARM.  See xinit in cmd/dist/build.go.  And those will set the default values.  Those are the ones you need here.\n\nI think the way to handle this correctly is to have cmd/go import cmd/internal/obj and pick up the values from there.  That is a new dependency but I think it is OK because we have to build cmd/internal/obj to bootstrap the tools anyhow.",
