      "message": "No, I made a mistake. Map and channel values can be converted to unsafe.Pointer, but not directly---only via reflect.Value.UnsafePointer. And as far as I know they cannot be converted from unsafe.Pointer even via reflection.\n\nI has assumed that the fact that they could be converted to unsafe.Pointer meant that they were pointer-like, no more and no less, and that this should be covered in the spec, but through reflection slices can also be converted to unsafe.Pointer and they are clearly more than just a pointer, so this doesn\u0027t prove anything.\n\nThis paragraph can be removed.",
