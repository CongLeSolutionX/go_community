      "message": "Yes, this CL only puts IO-ready Gs on the global runq, hopefully the schedtick will increase quickly.\n\nThis CL focus on transforming IO-ready Gs to _Grunnable instead of _Grunning as soon as possible. If we want scheduler prefer running IO-ready Gs, or behave like the linux cfs/deadline policy, much more complex work needed to be done.\n\nIt\u0027s ok to occasionally perform a non-blocking netpoll here. However, This may waste cpu if we do this too often, because IO is likely not ready yet. If we do this too infrequently, IO-ready Gs may miss a wakeup. We can\u0027t predicate when will IO Gs get ready.",
