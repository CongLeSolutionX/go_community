      "message": "This change needs an integration test (in `cmd/go/testdata/script`) demonstrating `go list` commands similar to the ones in the issue report.\n\nNamely:\n- The test should have a `go.mod` file that requires some module that is present in the test proxy (`cmd/go/testdata/mod`).\n- The test should have a `.go` source file that imports a package from that module.\n- The test should compare the output of `go list -m -json` for that module with and without the exact version string named in the `go.mod` file.",
