      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should be modifying the global maxbg. It has already been read in util.go and setting it to a different value will not affect the number of goroutines in that work pool.\n\nSetting it here only affects the loop below, so you should probably read maxbg above this loop into a local, and use/modify that local subsequently.",
