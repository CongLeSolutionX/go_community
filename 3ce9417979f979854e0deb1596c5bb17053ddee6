They must be removed for parsing.\n\u003e This would be much more complex.\n\u003e \n\u003e Without updating the documentation, it could be mentioned somewhere.\n\u003e \n\u003e A few tests were removed because of problems on\n\u003e one platform. It might be an opportunity to reinstate them.\n\nHowdy Constantin, could you please point me to the cases that you mentioned that were removed?",

      "message": "Two cases of TestDateParsingCFWS in net/mail/message_test.go started failing on one builder. The issue of reference is https://github.com/golang/go/issues/34854\nIssue was closed by setting an empty time.Time{} for those tests the day following the merge of CFWS support.\n\nThe change that removed these tests refers to a change of zoninfo data. There are a few others issues which are related to zoneinfo. There is maybe some explanations there.\n\nThis issue seems to duplicate #34854 as one comment in the tests mentions support for obsolete time zone (CST in this case). Maybe removing support for obsolete time zone was deliberate.",
