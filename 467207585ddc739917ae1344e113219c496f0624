      "message": "I\u0027m probably going to follow up with another CL this week which improves the flow of this a bit. Right now, if coverage is disabled and someone runs fuzzing with `-run\u003dNone` to disable the fuzz target\u0027s initial seed corpus checks, then we could start fuzzing without ever running the seed corpus once. That seems broken to me. (What if someone introduced a bug that their seed corpus would have already covered, and we start writing \"new\" crasher files in testdata/fuzz that don\u0027t actually expand the test coverage)\n\nBut this should work in the interim, and fixes some other issues anyway.",
