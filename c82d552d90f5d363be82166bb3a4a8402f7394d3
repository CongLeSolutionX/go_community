There are no changes to these files except that they have moved into a directory.\n\nThe changes to the other files are minimal: In many cases the errors reported by types2 are better (e.g., fewer duplicate errors), and/or match the existing compiler error text.\n\nThere\u0027s one or two errors that types2 doesn\u0027t report yet and which have been disabled.",
