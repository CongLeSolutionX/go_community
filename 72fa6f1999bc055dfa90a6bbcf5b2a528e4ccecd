      "message": "@iant@golang.org Sorry for the delay due to holidays and other tasks in the backlog. Next iterations, if any, will be quicker.\n\nI have updated the different commits. It should now be aligned with what was asked in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/56539#issuecomment-1332585915 as requested in your previous comment.\n\nI hope it has been done correctly but please tell me if not if you don\u0027t mind.\n\nRegarding the different modifications done here in the last version:\n- add mptcpStatus type (2nd commit of the series)\n- implement SetMultipathTCP and MultipathTCP (instead of an attribute in Dialer and ListenerConfig structure) as agreed in #56539\n- adapt the tests accordingly\n- move tcp.MultipathTCP() at the end: it was not initially discussed in #56539 but it seems needed for the tests and for the users of the net package interested to use MPTCP and check it has been correctly used. In fact, I misunderstood what \"MultipathTCP\" function was supposed to do when discussed in #56539: I thought it was supposed to check if a fallback to TCP has been done or not.\n- commit messages:\n - remove \"()\" after function names\n - remove git tags (Signed-off-by, Co-developed-by, Reviewed-by, Link, Fixes)\n - some small improvements and adaptations due to the recent modifications",
