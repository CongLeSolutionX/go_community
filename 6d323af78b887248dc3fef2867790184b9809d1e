Seems like that could lead to problems (although I can\u0027t really think of a situation where it would right at the moment.)\n\nI am somewhat surprised that the (ADD x y) doesn\u0027t go away with the rule. Although even if it did, that doesn\u0027t solve the problem where uses of (ADD x y) would not match (Select0 (ADDCC x y)).",
