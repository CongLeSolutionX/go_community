What is the proxy?\n\nI think you want to say functions compiled with the -shared option because it is not just shared objects (also dynamic binaries). And this explanation is not quite complete, because code compiled as shared must maintain R2 throughout the code, so R2 is initialized at the start of the function, and saved if it might be clobbered so that it can be restored following any clobbering function calls.",
