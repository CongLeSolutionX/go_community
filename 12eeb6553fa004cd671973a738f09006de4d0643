      "message": "No worries. As this can potentially break existing program (even if that code is actually unsafe and happens to work), we probably want to check this in early in cycle for the next release. We may also want to add a GODEBUG flag so user can debug or fall back to old behavior, either a new GODEBUG or a level in invalidptr. I\u0027ll for sure redo google-internal tests and understand the failures (if any) before the next cycle starts. Thanks.",

(What I did a little earlier today was to make CL 543936 and CL 543935 only check for invalid pointers with invalidptr\u003d2, with the default temporarily set to 2 for testing, but set the default back to 1 in CL 544176; I also posted a related question on #62653).\n\nIn any event, I\u0027d be excited to see progress here -- I think it could help a fair amount.",
