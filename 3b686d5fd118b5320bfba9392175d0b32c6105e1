      "message": "I gave up on my attempt to spin until a mutex profile event has been recorded. \n\nInstead I moved the test case into the runtime/pprof package which already has the code that\u0027s needed to reliably produce mutex events (`awaitBlockedGoroutine`, `blockMutex`).\n\nAnother option would be to put `awaitBlockedGoroutine` into an internal package, which I also briefly played with, but in the end I decided that moving the test case is the most pragmatic choice for now.\n\nShould I add Michael K as a second reviewer or do you have somebody else in mind?",
