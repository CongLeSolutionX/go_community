      "message": "The new comment is more accurate in one dimension, but now less accurate in another dimension.\n\nWe need to capture two effects:\n* When matching a particular JSON name to a Go struct field, we prefer exact match over a case-insensitive match (e.g., https://go.dev/play/p/8PHUZJFqDHO).\n* JSON object members are unmarhaled in the order syntactically seen. Thus, latter members that matches a previously seen Go struct field will be \"merged\" into the field.\n\nI use the term \"merge\" loosely since it\u0027s neither true merging nor overriding. The exact semantics are complicated.",

      "message": "Why is it to overwriting? See here: https://go.dev/play/p/2a3kQ03Ij10\n\nIn both cases the first field gets overwritten by the json field \"NAME\". I would not expect this and i think its a bug and not just an unprecise documentation.\n\nIn the example i would expect the output:\n\n{Foo Bar}\n{Bar Foo} \n\nbut it is \n\n{BAZ Bar}\n{BAR Foo}\n\nThe decoder is correctly assigning fields with exact matches. But if it has a field where no exact match can be found, it selects the first field in the struct and just writes its value, even if the value is already set.",
