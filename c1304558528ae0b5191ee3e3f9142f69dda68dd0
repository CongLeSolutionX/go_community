      "message": "The new comment is more accurate in one dimension, but now less accurate in another dimension.\n\nWe need to capture two effects:\n* When matching a particular JSON name to a Go struct field, we prefer exact match over a case-insensitive match (e.g., https://go.dev/play/p/8PHUZJFqDHO).\n* JSON object members are unmarhaled in the order syntactically seen. Thus, latter members that matches a previously seen Go struct field will be \"merged\" into the field.\n\nI use the term \"merge\" loosely since it\u0027s neither true merging nor overriding. The exact semantics are complicated.",
