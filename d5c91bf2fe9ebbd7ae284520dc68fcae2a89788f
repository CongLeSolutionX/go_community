Whereas here in registerTests specifically, nothing is built since its point is to discover and register tests, not to test/build/vet anything.)\n\nCan you clarify, or maybe leave this sentence out?",

It\u0027s not mentioned in the commit message, has no comment and seems be dropping cgo test packages.\n\nAlso, I think it\u0027d be good to keep the property that \u0027dist test\u0027 finds all problems that \u0027go test std cmd\u0027 does, unless the motivation to make \u0027dist test\u0027 a subset of that is quite compelling.",

Removed that.\n\nFor vendor, I think we want to keep not testing in those directories. We know vendoring doesn\u0027t include tests anyway, so it would only be running vet, and we don\u0027t care a ton about vet in those directories either since we can\u0027t just edit the code to fix them. And it prints a _lot_ during all.bash (we vendor too much, but that\u0027s a different problem). Since we\u0027ve never tested them before, I think it\u0027s okay to keep not testing them.",
