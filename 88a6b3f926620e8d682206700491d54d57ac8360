      "message": "test/codegen and asmcheck are usually used for testing optimizations. Since this is a correctness bug, I would put the test to test/fixedbugs and use \"// run\" directive. The test can simply panic if the result is wrong.\n\nTesting the register allocation is really looking into implementation detail too much.\n\nThanks.",
