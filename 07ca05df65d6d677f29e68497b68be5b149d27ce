      "message": "(minor) This puts a module with declaration `module a` at $GOPATH/src/b, which users will hopefully ~never do.\n\nCan we put it somewhere else? (Perhaps an alternate GOPATH somewhere, or someplace outside of GOPATH?)\n\nIdeally either the test should pass regardless of the value of GO111MODULE, or the test should pass in module mode and some `go` command should fail in GOPATH mode. (I believe that for this patchset one of the test assertions would fail instead, because the binary would be build with a different effective import path.)",
