      "message": "OpError uses Source-\u003eDestination.  Prior to this change, this line was logging Destination-\u003eSource, which seemed obviously wrong to me.\n\nAre you suggesting that I reverse both the arrow and the parameters (tt.taddr+\"-\u003e\"+tt.saddr) ?  That would still sort of make sense, but has the disadvantage that the chronology is backwards.\n\nWhen describing the situation, \"first a server is created, then a client connects to the server\", server\u003c-client just seems like the most clear and unambiguous notation.",
