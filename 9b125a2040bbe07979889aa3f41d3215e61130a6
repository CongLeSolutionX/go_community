      "message": "I don\u0027t think that explicitly modifying the mtime in the test is a good idea, unless we modify it to match its existing value found by some other means.\n\nFor one, we want the test to pass even if the user running it does not have permission to modify GOROOT (see #28387).\n\nFor two, the cache entry for a test includes metadata about the files it has accessed (see https://tip.golang.org/pkg/internal/testlog/), so this modification could cause the test to persistently fail to cache.\n\nIs there some way we can walk over the tree and flush the MFT cache without actually changing the file metadata? (Does `fstest.TestFS` itself end up flushing the cache somehow?)",
