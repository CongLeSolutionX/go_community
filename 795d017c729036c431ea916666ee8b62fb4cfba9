If Go-Release-Cycle wiki is still actual, that\u0027s February for the next release, right?\n\nI only uploaded (and can build amd64) version. The interface between Go runtime and tsan did not change, so arches can be updated separately. Though, of course, it\u0027s sub-optimal if get them diverge.\nI am not sure how all can be re-built. I\u0027ve seen an s390x version and I guess it\u0027s not supported by racebuild tool.",
