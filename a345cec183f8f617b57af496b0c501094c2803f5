      "message": "This line can be replaced with `if data.Less(first+lo, first+position) {` and still be correct.\n\nIn case all elements are different, the two lines are obviously equivalent, but if there are equal elements, then this line represents a trade-off between calls to `Less` and calls to `Swap`.\n\nThe current proposed implementation minimizes the number of `Less` calls. If we change it to the alternative, then we will do a little more calls to `Less` and a little fewer calls to `Swap`.\n\nThe sum of the number of calls to `Less` and `Swap` is constant, so it really depends if in most applications `Less`\u0027s are more expensive than `Swap`\u0027s or not.\n\nMy intuition is that this will likely not make a difference, since this code will only be called for very non-typical inputs, where I expect most elements to be different from one another.",
