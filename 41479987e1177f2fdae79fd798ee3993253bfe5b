      "message": "Hey Tom, sorry for the lag getting back to you on this. We went back and forth for a while today internally about what we actually want this functionality to look like and ended up deciding on something somewhat different from what is described in #41181, which we\u0027ve landed in 262857 (essentially only reordering adjacent AEADs in the preference list).\n\nSorry for asking you for changes and then going down a completely different path, but thanks for your comments which helped steer us in the right direction!",
