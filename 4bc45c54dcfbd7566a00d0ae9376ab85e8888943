      "message": "If possible, I would like to discuss whether this implementation would also need support for registering context-value preservation handlers to keep special values alive and handle their closure when the detached child is done.  This is something we\u0027ve needed internally, and I\u0027d hate to have a fragmented implementation.\n\nI\u0027ve added someone who can help suss this out, but he\u0027s out on vacation.",

      "message": "+1 - This is an important use-case. We don\u0027t have to try to cover every use case in a stdlib package, but in my mind the ones that are both common and hard to do correctly are worth including.  It gives us the opportunity to design the API and the documentation to encourage correct and limited use of the functionality, and means that moving from one code base that needs it to another allows the nuances and care required to be transferable skills.",

Just as a heads-up, the proposal is almost approved, so the window is closing fast. \n\nAt the same time, I don\u0027t see why what you\u0027re proposing shouldn\u0027t be doable in a second moment, hence why the proposal itself should be held up because of it.",
