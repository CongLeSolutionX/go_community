      "message": "This construct seems odd to me. The doc for the `Dir` type says “A Dir implements FileSystem using the native file system restricted to a specific directory tree.”\n\n`testdata/index.html` is not a “directory tree” — it is a file, not a directory. I would intuitively expect it to return an error for every call to `Open`, more or less the same as if one constructed a `Dir` from a nonexistent file path.\n\nAt the very least, if it is valid to use `Dir` on a non-directory I would expect the documentation for `http.Dir` to define its behavior more clearly.",

Do you think it is okay to use the current solution as long as it is documented in http.Dir? Or you are more inclined to return an error and document it as well?",

I think it is still safer to just serve the file directly, even tho this is not documented anywhere.
