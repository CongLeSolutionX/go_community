      "message": "I experimented a bit to understand why this happens. One place I found is that this function may be called with a mask with \"desired-to-avoid registers\" (desired to save for other values) excluded, but the code below just picking a free register without checking this desired-to-avoid thing (it probably should). Understanding this makes me happier in that the code doesn\u0027t do things we don\u0027t understand.\n\nFor Wasm, I can see that copy isn\u0027t cheaper so we don\u0027t do it. But why it breaks the stack optimization?",
