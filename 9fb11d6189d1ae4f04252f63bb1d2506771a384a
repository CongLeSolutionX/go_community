Test the package on host\nand run the subtests on target?\n\nwhy not just copy Go to the target and test there?\n\nGo itself is mostly statically linked, so it doesn\u0027t\nneed many dependencies to run on target. Only\nthe gcc executions are problematic.\n\nHowever, I imagine that there could be gcc script\non the target that relays the command back to\nhost to do remote cross compilation.\n\nthis is possible with distcc.",
