Even though this won\u0027t affect @latest, it may affect other queries (e.g., @v2), and it will affect \u0027go list -m -versions` output (which is displayed in places like pkg.go.dev).\n\nAre we just worried about performance here? ReadFile may fetch one ref on each call, but we could probably speed it up.",
