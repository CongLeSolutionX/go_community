I know it\u0027s not part of the Go 1 API contract, but saying it supports JSON is kind of a sign that it\u0027s an API, so it should be stable.\n\nI think you should probably map it to a struct type instead, with a \"cgo\" JSON field, so it\u0027s obvious what it is, and gives room to grow. (but mostly so it\u0027s self-describing).",
