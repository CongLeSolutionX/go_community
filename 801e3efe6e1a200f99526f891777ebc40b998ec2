      "message": "I think if there is no loong64 hardware without floating point support there is no need to add and maintain softfloat. Adding it means more testing and builders needed as well as potential bugs needing to be fixed. Its also seems easier to add an option later than removing one if its clear its not used/needed.",

      "message": "Per the LoongArch reference manualï¼Œthe support for floating-point instructions is optional. So I think that we can keep the softfloat mode for loong64.\n\nThe related content on floating-point in LoongArch reference manual:\nGenerally speaking, it recommends that implementing both basic integer instructions and basic floating-point instructions at the same time. However, for some embedded applications that are cost-sensitive and have extremely low floating-point processing performance requirements, the architecture specification also allows not to implement basic floating-point instructions, or only implement single-precision floating-point numbers and word integers in basic floating-point instructions. Whether the implementation of basic floating-point instructions includes instructions for operating double-precision floating-point numbers and double-word integers has nothing to do with whether the architecture is LA32 or LA64.\n\nhttps://github.com/loongson/LoongArch-Documentation/blob/main/docs/LoongArch-Vol1-EN/basic-floating-point-instructions.adoc",
