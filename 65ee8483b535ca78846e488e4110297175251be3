There is some ongoing work on ARM on WINE but I\u0027ve never run it:\n\nhttps://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a\u003dsearch\u0026h\u003dHEAD\u0026st\u003dcommit\u0026s\u003d+ARM\n\nHopefully we can delete the Wine path at some point. There\u0027s been a patch in wine-staging for a while to add the PEB reads that the non-Wine path uses, but it still hasn\u0027t been merged, presumably because the approach of spawning a thread to update that variable is slow.",
