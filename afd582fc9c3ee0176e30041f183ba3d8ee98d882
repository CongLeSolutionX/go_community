      "message": "Is there an issue or proposal for this work?\n\nI added the support for -msan a few years ago.  At the time there didn\u0027t seem to be any reason to add support for -asan.  Go code is inherently asan-safe, unless people intentionally use the unsafe package, in which case they are on their own.  Linking Go code with C code compiled with -fsanitize\u003daddress does seem to required any special attention.\n\nSo I think it would be appropriate to at least open an issue for discussion here.  Thanks.",
