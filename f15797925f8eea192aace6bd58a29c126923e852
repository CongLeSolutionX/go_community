      "message": "I believe the intent was for webpack (or another bundler that does the same thing?) to already be supported but the check is not working and useless as it is currently. i.e. the outcome of the conditional can NEVER be true.\n\nThis really is a fix to that check, not _adding_ support for webpack - which is what I\u0027d assume the suggested commit message would imply.\n\nMaybe it would be more informative to say:\n\nmisc/wasm: fix empty global fs check for webpack support",

      "message": "nit: we don\u0027t use markdown backticks in commit messages in general, because they are plaintext; you could instead use single or double quotes to separate names if you want, as that\u0027s just more general English.\n\nSee https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CommitMessage. Some \"light\" markdown like tab-indented blocks, or bulleted lists, are still OK as they are both generally fine in plain English as well.",
