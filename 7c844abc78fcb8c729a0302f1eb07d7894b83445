      "message": "This logopt code was added (CL 206658) before I split the \"batch\" and \"escape\" types out separately (CL 280997). It was using \"e.curfn\" here, but e.curfn was always nil at this point in escape analysis. So I just preserved that behavior during the refactoring.\n\n(In general, I\u0027m not a fan of the duplicated logic across the fmt.Printfs and the logopt.LogOpts, but that seems like a massive yak shaving to try to address.)",
