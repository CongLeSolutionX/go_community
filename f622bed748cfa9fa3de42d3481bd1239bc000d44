      "message": "Got it. I suppose it\u0027s lucky that the files that need to be changed are not yet generated.\n\nI still suggest the following, to keep go/types and types2 as close as possible: underneath `var gotypesalias \u003d ...`, define a helper `func useNewAliasNode() bool`, and make the implementation of that func the *only* difference between go/types and types2.\n\nWhere you have commented out `os.Setenv`, make it\n```\nif !useNewAliasNode() {\n  os.Setenv(\"GODEBUG\", \"gotypesalias\u003d1\") // this test expects Alias nodes\n}\n```\n\nEtc. Sorry to make you jump through hoops, but we\u0027ve learned from experience to try to keep go/types and types2 always as close to eachother as possible. Like spinning plates, we don\u0027t want to deviate too far from the center...",
