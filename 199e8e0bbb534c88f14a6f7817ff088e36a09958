It will take a few hours.  The results will land in subdirectory \"bench\" in files with names like 20230404T212631.{Old,New}.{benchsize,benchdwarf,build,stdout}\n\nThis will optionally run some other programs, perflock\n( https://github.com/aclements/perflock/ )\nif your arch/os supports that, and various tools used by \"benchdwarf\".\n\nOur attitude towards these benchmarks suites is that we are somewhat more interested in changes that move the geometric mean, but also pay attention to large movements in individual benchmarks.  A CL that improves geomean by 1% but slows down one benchmark by 10% is worth keeping (in my opinion), but then we\u0027ll file a bug against the lost 10%.",
