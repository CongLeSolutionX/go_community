      "message": "This comment doesn\u0027t make much sense in context. I don\u0027t see anything about strings in the immediately following code. Perhaps something like:\n\n// For strings, we want rcap\u003d\u003drlen, for use in masking, even though rcap is otherwise unused.\n\nAnd then explain why the following code does that. I don\u0027t see why j\u003d\u003dk for all strings. Maybe I\u0027m missing something, or maybe this is supposed to be\n\nrcap :\u003d rlen\nif t.IsString() || j !\u003d k {\n  rcap \u003d ...\n}",
