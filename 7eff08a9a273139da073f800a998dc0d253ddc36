      "message": "Got it, thanks for the quick reply. I noticed that there is a bunch of special methods for accessing maps below (maplen, mapiternext) and I was following that convention. Do I understand correctly that this is a deprecated approach and should not be continued?\n\nI understand the best course of action would be to raise this issue on gonuts and propose this as a public method on a map?",
