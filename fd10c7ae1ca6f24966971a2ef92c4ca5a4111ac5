Maybe \"The default behavior for sigPreempt is to ignore the signal, so badsignal will be a no-op anyway.\"\n\nWe may want to mention the OpenBSD behavior as justification for why we\u0027re bothering anyway. The performance of avoiding badsignal in an extremely rare case doesn\u0027t seem like good justification on its own, and maybe we should drop this added complexity once OpenBSD 6.2 is no longer supported.",
