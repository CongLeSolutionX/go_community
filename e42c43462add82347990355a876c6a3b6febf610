But perhaps that check ought to be even more restrictive, so that we don\u0027t allow embedded files locally that won\u0027t work in a published module version.\n\nPer https://golang.org/ref/mod#zip-path-size-constraints:\n\u003e File and directory names within a module may consist of Unicode letters,\n\u003e ASCII digits, the ASCII space character (U+0020), and the ASCII\n\u003e punctuation characters !#$%\u0026()+,-.\u003d@[]^_{}~.\n\nSo perhaps validEmbedPattern should call module.CheckFilePath instead of (or in addition to) fs.ValidPath?",

(It does demonstrate that mixing fs.ValidPath with non-fs filepath.Glob calls is not a great idea, but don\u0027t think that\u0027s a defect in the io/fs API.)",
