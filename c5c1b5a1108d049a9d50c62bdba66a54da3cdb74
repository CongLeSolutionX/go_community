      "message": "\u003e But here I see we were previously formatting the underlying.\n\nBut it wasn\u0027t previously formatting the underlying! Before types.Alias, an alias was a TypeName with the IsAlias flag, whose type was the RHS of the assignment, not the underlying. So you would see \"type A \u003d B\" (not \"type A \u003d int\"). With materialized aliases, the type of the TypeName is an Alias, so you would see \"type A \u003d A\". This CL\u0027s behavior change to ObjectString fixes that bug by preserving the previous behavior of displaying the RHS.",
