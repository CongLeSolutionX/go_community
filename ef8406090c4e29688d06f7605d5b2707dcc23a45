      "message": "ah, good point. you\u0027re right, not an issue since only the pages it actually uses get touched. it\u0027s not even a problem for Windows, since it won\u0027t back a committed region with physical pages until they actually get touched (see the MEM_COMMIT docs here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/memoryapi/nf-memoryapi-virtualalloc).\n\nI think that\u0027s reason enough to abandon this change, since it turns out this shouldn\u0027t actually be an issue.",
