Maybe \"abi\" or \"rtabi\"?\n\nI want to eliminate types\u0027s use of obj.LSym, because those details really belong to ir.Name, not types.Sym. Also because I\u0027m hoping to prune down types\u0027s API to match types2, which doesn\u0027t know about LSyms.",

      "message": "I tried this. It didn\u0027t work to put all of Names, Syms, Pkgs in a new package because the next CL moves methodSymSuffix to ir, and that needs to refer to Pkgs.Go, and of course Names refers back to ir, which makes a cycle.\n\nThe cycle didn\u0027t exist before because I already put Names in ir. I could put Syms and Pkgs into a separate package and leave Names in ir, but given that ir is going to import that separate package, it seems like just putting them in ir is fine, especially since they are already behind a single top-level name (well two).\n\nSo done: moved to ir.",
