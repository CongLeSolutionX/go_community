      "message": "This was necessary at one point to prevent the -d\u003dlibfuzzer gcflag from being cleared out. setToolFlags was being called multiple times in some circumstances. When that happened, the p.Internal.Gcflags which held the -d\u003dlibfuzzer flag would get removed.\n(See https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/312009/comments/d0df4c34_13994fd0 and https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/321960 for the previous context)\n\nHowever, I tried to reproduce this locally to see if the same problem occurs now that the code is removed, and I can\u0027t reproduce it. I just wish I knew what was changed to no longer require this workaround. I\u0027ll look into it.",
