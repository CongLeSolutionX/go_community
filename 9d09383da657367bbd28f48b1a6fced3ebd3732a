However, XCOFF needs that the size of a section is equal to the sum of its symbols\u0027 size. The reason is that the symbols\u0027 size are used to compute the size of a XCOFF section (called csect). \n\nIn internal linker, a csect corresponds to all function in a pkg. Thus, there is no way (or at least it was the case when I\u0027ve made the algorithm) to get this size without recomputing it. However, in external linker, all the pkg are merged into a single csect, which then becomes the sum of all sections. \nThus, I have a workaround (cf other comment). \n\nHowever, if there is a way to update the last symbol before creating the new .text section, it would be better. The way pkg are handled for external linker is already a workaround thus it would create a workaround over a workaround. I\u0027m not really fond of that 😄",
