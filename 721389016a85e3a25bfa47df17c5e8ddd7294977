      "message": "Thanks for this CL. While this looks like a valid solution to the problem mentioned in the comment in the code (of writing to a named pipe created by Bash\u0027s \u003e(cmd) syntax), I am concerned that there are a great many places in the Go project where os.Create is used without a similar fallback to open(WRONLY), and in principal all of them have a similar problem. Rather than spend the effort to fix them either piecemeal or systematically, I am tempted to say that named pipes are just not similar enough to regular files for us to support them as such in all our command-line interfaces.\n\nDamien, what do you think?",
