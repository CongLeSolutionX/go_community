      "message": "Thanks for this CL. While this looks like a valid solution to the problem mentioned in the comment in the code (of writing to a named pipe created by Bash\u0027s \u003e(cmd) syntax), I am concerned that there are a great many places in the Go project where os.Create is used without a similar fallback to open(WRONLY), and in principal all of them have a similar problem. Rather than spend the effort to fix them either piecemeal or systematically, I am tempted to say that named pipes are just not similar enough to regular files for us to support them as such in all our command-line interfaces.\n\nDamien, what do you think?",

      "message": "Your concerns make sense, but perhaps I can share a bit more context.\n\nI\u0027m currently working on a new viewer for execution traces. One feature it supports is visualizing go execution traces in real time. This allows you to invoke a long running `go test` and watch what each of the involved goroutines is doing. It also works for server programs that offer an [http endpoint](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof#Trace) serving execution traces.\n\nSo from my PoV the `-trace` option is special in the sense that it produces a stream of data that is useful, even if incomplete (as long as 1 generation, i.e. 1 second of data, is captured). Many other file-writing flags do not share this property.",

      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem to be a problem on Linux. On my Linux machine, `go test -trace \u003e(wc)` pipes the trace to wc.\n\nThis does seem to be a problem on macOS.\n\nThe issue on macOS is that /dev/fd/XX is read-only in this case. os.Create opens files with O_RDWR, so the open fails.\n\nIf we were to make a change here, I think it should be to use `os.OpenFile(path, os.O_WRONLY|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0666)` instead of os.Create. This is identical to Create, except for opening the file write-only rather than read-write.\n\nThe testing package currently uses `os.Create` for:\n\n- `-coverprofile`\n- `-cpuprofile`\n- `-trace`\n- `-testlogfile`\n- `-memprofile`\n- `-blockprofile`\n- `-mutexprofile`\n\nI think that if we change any of these, we should change all of them.\n\nConsidering just the behavior, opening output-only files with O_WRONLY seems reasonable; we\u0027re not going to read the file, so why should we require that the file be readable?\n\nOn the other hand, eschewing os.Create every time we want to create a file isn\u0027t appealing.\n\nI think I lean slightly towards saying that that, at least in the testing package, we should pick user convenience over our own convenience and consistently open output files O_WRONLY. That probably means introducing a new function (openOutputFile? openFileForWriting? createWriteOnly?) and using it instead of os.Create.",
