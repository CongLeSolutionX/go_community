      "message": "@drchase did some pretty extensive benchmarking of this change and it came out very slightly negative. I don\u0027t think we want to take this CL as-is, unfortunately.\n\nI think there is a kernel of a good idea here, but maybe we\u0027d need to be more judicious in applying it. Probably investigating some of the regressing cases would help. Does it cause more spills? Something else?",

This benchmarking was done with randomized link order (75 differently ordered binaries) to help wash out branch alignment effects, but that also causes noise on benchmarks that are sensitive to those (arguably we should get rid of those benchmarks).",

      "message": "Thank you for sharing! For a quick look, comparing to my runs there seems only similar result on FPAQ benchmark, but it is small enough, about 1%. Looking though benchmarks disassembly I haven\u0027t noticed significant changes like additional spills -- in most cases there was identical code and the changed functions looked like slight improvement mostly, e.g. avoiding a bound check. I\u0027ll try to look at difference for the affected tests.",
