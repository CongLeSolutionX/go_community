      "message": "Ian, per our discussion I\u0027ve used build constraints to work around the bootstrapping issue. PTAL\n\nAnother problem that had to be solved is the new circular dependency arising from the sort-\u003eslices dependency. Since several stdlib packages depend on sort, including \"testing\", I had to move all slices tests into a slices_test package. Moreover, since many tests and benchmarks in slices depended on sort, I moved these to sort_test instead. This seems more natural now given the dependencies (compare the packages in a place where both are present), but maybe it\u0027s possible to keep them where they are, moving them to slices_test. I don\u0027t feel strongly either way.",
