      "message": "OK, there is something I don\u0027t understand here.  For other CorruptInputError cases we always use a value based on olen.  So I think that that offset is going to be an offset into the bytes returned by this call to Read.  (Although that may not be true if len(d.out) \u003e 0, not sure what to do about that.)\n\nAnyhow, the CorruptInputError number that we are returning here doesn\u0027t have anything to do with the bytes being returned from Read.  In fact, we aren\u0027t returning any bytes from Read.  So it seems to me that for this case we may as well always just return CorruptInputError(0), indicating that the problem was in bytes returned earlier.  That will simply this code.  Happy to hear other opinions.",
