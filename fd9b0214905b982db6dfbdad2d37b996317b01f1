Thank you for making this easy to review. \n\nI went through a side-by-side diff of the code from x/crypto 616635 and this CR and all of the points of difference made sense to me (or I left small comments about). With the exception of one small test diff I think all of the comments would be resolved by the sync this CR\u0027s description already calls for to happen pre-merge.",
