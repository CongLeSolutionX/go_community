Also if rekeying or something like that should be also logged after handshake. I don\u0027t know TLS in that much detail.\n\nThis is simple enough so I thought this is fine, and at least it\u0027s easy to see that we return the internal error alert if writing fails (which normally it can\u0027t since the logger is nil).",
