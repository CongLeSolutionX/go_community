This sentence \u0026 code example teaches the reader that \"If you need X, you need to import X\". Later they use \"log\" and if they get a compilation error, they\u0027ll remember they need to import X.\n\nI\u0027d rather have the user hit that learning point than muddle this text up.",

The \"The html/template package\" section explicitly mentions this - \n\n\"First, we must add \u003ccode\u003ehtml/template\u003c/code\u003e to the list of imports. We\nalso won\u0027t be using \u003ccode\u003efmt\u003c/code\u003e anymore, so we have to remove that.\"\n\nTo keep the tone consistent, I think we should add this line too.\n\nIf not the line, atleast we should add the imports. The bold text will make it clear that it is being added.",
