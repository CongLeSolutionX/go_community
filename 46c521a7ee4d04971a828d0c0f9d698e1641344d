      "message": "This wording is indeed confusing. What I meant is that this mirrors the change in text/template.evalArgs, which is also changed to stringify a single untyped nil as empty string.\n\nBoth are used only when escaping values, such as when doing HTML escaping. So a text/template that simply prints an untyped nil will still print \"\u003cno value\u003e\", as there\u0027s no escaping involved. And yes, there are tests in text/template for that behavior.",
