This is confirmed by running\n\n  go build -gcflags\u003d\"-d\u003dssa/check_bce/debug\u003d1\" \n\nFor this function it shows\n\n  ./draw.go:309:18: Found IsSliceInBounds\n  ./draw.go:310:18: Found IsSliceInBounds\n  ./draw.go:312:13: Found IsSliceInBounds\n  ./draw.go:321:13: Found IsSliceInBounds\n\nRemoving the cap expressions does not change this output, but removing the len of the subslice reintroduces bounds checks for each element being accessed. So I think there is something else going on here, not just bounds elimination. I did notice that the assembly is smaller with the cap present and has different instructions in this area but I\u0027m not proficient enough with reading it to describe what is going on.

      "message": "The bounds check elimination is working correctly. The compiler is emitting a single bounds check for the creation of the subslice. However there is a performance difference between:\n\n  s :\u003d spix[i : i+4]\n\nand \n\n  s :\u003d spix[i : i+4 : i+4]\n\nThis appears to be caused by better assembly being produced. I put a demonstration at https://gist.github.com/iand/342b35819355191aed2a9806434e62be. Compare the assembly when len is specified (https://gist.github.com/iand/342b35819355191aed2a9806434e62be#file-bounds-asm-L271) with the assembly for the short cap (https://gist.github.com/iand/342b35819355191aed2a9806434e62be#file-bounds-asm-L441).
