      "message": "But there is no way to write a constant IEEE -0.0.  And converting -0.0 to 0.0 is not rounding.  And the trailing \".0\" is unnecessary.\n\nI see that you are just copying this text but perhaps we can improve it.  How about something like:\n\nT is a floating-point type and x can be rounded to T\u0027s precision without overflow.  Rounding uses IEEE 754 round-to-even rules.  Note that constant values never result in an IEEE negative zero or an IEEE infinity.\n\nThis is still imperfect because it leaves the case of negative zero ambiguous.  A negative zero is \"in the set of values determined by T\" to arguably it could be satisfied by the first case, above.",
