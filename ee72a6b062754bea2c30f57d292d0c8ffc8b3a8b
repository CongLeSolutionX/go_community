      "message": "If I\u0027m reading correctly, `r.remote` is usually just `\"origin\"`, which would imply the need for a `--git-dir` in this command.\n\nStepping up a bit, though: it seems fairly fragile to add `--git-dir` flags explicitly to every command. The `git` documentation seems to suggest that the `GIT_DIR` environment variable can be set instead of the flag â€” would it make sense for `codehose.RunWithStdin` to always do something like:\n```\nc.Env \u003d append(c.Environ(), \"GIT_DIR\u003d\"+dir)\n```\nso that we can drop the repetition of individual flags?",

      "message": "Yeah, that would be great, and then I can drop the test changes too. Will reroll.\n\nThat said, I haven\u0027t figured out how to test that this does meet the requirements for us to turn on safe.bareRepository\u003dexplicit on our end; is there somewhere i can manipulate the default local gitconfig during the test suite to try it out? Adding that test would also help with the fragility you pointed out.",
