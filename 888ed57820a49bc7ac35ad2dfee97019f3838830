      "message": "It seems all current goTest methods only read their fields and don\u0027t try to modify them, so if you wanted, you could use value receivers instead of pointer receivers. That would let you invoke them with slightly fewer characters:\n\n```\ncmd :\u003d goTest{\n\tgoroot: moved,\n\tpkg:    \"fmt\",\n}.command(t)\n\n// Instead of the current:\ncmd :\u003d (\u0026goTest{\n\tgoroot: moved,\n\tpkg:    \"fmt\",\n}).command(t)\n```\n\nAnd maybe value receiver also communicates better that the methods aren\u0027t meant to mutate the struct fields.\n\nLeaving it as is completely fine, this is entirely optional.",
