Otherwise, please address any problems and update the GitHub PR. When complete, mark this comment as \u0027Done\u0027 and click the [blue \u0027Reply\u0027 button](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GerritBot#i-left-a-reply-to-a-comment-in-gerrit-but-no-one-but-me-can-see-it) above.\n\nPossible problems detected:\n  1. The commit message body is very brief. That can be OK if the change is trivial like correcting spelling or fixing a broken link, but usually the description should provide context for the change and explain what it does in complete sentences.\n\nTo edit the commit message, see instructions [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GerritBot/#how-does-gerritbot-determine-the-final-commit-message). For guidelines on commit messages for the Go project, see [here](https://go.dev/doc/contribute#commit_messages).\n\n\n(In general for Gerrit code reviews, the CL author is expected to close out each piece of feedback by marking it as \u0027Done\u0027 if implemented as suggested or otherwise reply to each review comment. See the [Review](https://go.dev/doc/contribute#review) section of the Contributing Guide for details.)",
