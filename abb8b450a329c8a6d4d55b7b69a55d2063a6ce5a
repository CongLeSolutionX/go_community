Also the \"This\" at the start of a sentence is poor, as it\u0027s unclear what it\u0027s referring to.\n\nHow about\n\nStop does not close the channel, to prevent a concurrent goroutine reading from the channel from seeing an erroneous \"tick\".",

If there\u0027s a consensus that the original was fine, I can close the PR.\n\nThanks everyone for bearing with me haha",
