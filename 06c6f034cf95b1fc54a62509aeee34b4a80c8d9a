I think this change is a step toward that, as it seeks to group the timer system into a single abstraction. I think that\u0027s good, but again, I have some reservations about the choices here.\n\nI think being more clear and explicit about the goals of this refactoring beyond \"cleaning up a mess\" would help a lot.",
