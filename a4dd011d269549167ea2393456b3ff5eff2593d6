      "message": "Playing with the loop index is correct but frightening. The first thing I thought when looking at the loop was: why isn\u0027t this for range loop? Now I understand. \n\nThis loop does two things: cleanup and finding statement si. For some reason, cleanup gets interrupted when si is found. I don\u0027t understand why.\n\nI strongly suggest to split this loop into two separate loops, each doings its separate thing: one loop for cleanup, one loop for finding si.\n\nAnd about the cleanup loop: It would be cleaner, but cost an allocation, to instead construct an entirely fresh filtered slice. I cannot judge the trade-off between the two, but I want to make sure that you chose willingly.",
