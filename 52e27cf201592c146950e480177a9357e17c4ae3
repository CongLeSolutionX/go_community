      "message": "I\u0027m trying to understand what is happening here.\n\nDoes this mean there are \"dummy\" functions written in Go asm somewhere (in the runtime?) and there is a known/fixed list of them. They are needed when linking with code compiled with gcc -Os. Somehow these are known as stackmap symbols?\n\nI don\u0027t know what it means that the linker \"enables\" them.\n\nI thought this was an issue with internal linking only? But your description doesn\u0027t mention that.",

Is the comment stale?  The comment seems to be implying that only the compiler emits these syms (and I don\u0027t see any declaration in Go code for these symbols).",
