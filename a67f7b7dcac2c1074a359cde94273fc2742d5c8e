      "message": "I wonder if we can just move the disableExport/declare calls here instead? This is after type-checking, so we should have already exited if there are any duplicate functions. Do you mind testing if that works?\n\nIn fact, I\u0027m kinda curious if we really have to disableExport/declare these symbols at all. declare()\u0027s primary responsibility is to associate a symbol (Sym) with a declaration (Node), so that \"oldname\" will work... but that shouldn\u0027t be necessary for function literals, since they\u0027re anonymous.",
