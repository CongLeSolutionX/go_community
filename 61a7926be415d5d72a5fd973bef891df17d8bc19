      "message": "Based on https://play.golang.org/p/2JzHDalGN7Q , I think the callback needs to have a few args, and has the args used after the runtime.GC call, so they are spilled (or maybe you can have the args address-taken, but don\u0027t escape the address). I think the problem was the args are spilled to the spill area (the callee thinks it has but not really), and clobbers the return PC of call16.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how to invoke a callback in the simplest way, though.",
