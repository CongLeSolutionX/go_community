It looks like the relative links for issues don’t work as I expected.\n\nThe pre-proposal discussion link on the live site now goes to the following, which doesn’t work:\n\nhttps://tip.golang.org/issue/56413\n\nIt seems a preexisting issue URL a couple of paragraphs down on the live site has a similar issue:\n\nhttps://tip.golang.org/issue/62047\n\nI can send a new CL in a bit.",

      "message": "The \"/issue/nnn\" pattern is what we want to use long term. It will work fine once the release notes are moved to x/website\u0027s _content/doc directory. It would be good to make it work on tip.golang.org but let\u0027s leave that to be dealt with holistically. (We don\u0027t want to make `tip.golang.org/issue/12345` links something other than 404 to avoid them being used by accident; but x/website can rewrite them when rendering at tip.golang.org.)",
