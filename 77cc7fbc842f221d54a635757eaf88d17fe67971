It looks like the relative links for issues don’t work as I expected.\n\nThe pre-proposal discussion link on the live site now goes to the following, which doesn’t work:\n\nhttps://tip.golang.org/issue/56413\n\nIt seems a preexisting issue URL a couple of paragraphs down on the live site has a similar issue:\n\nhttps://tip.golang.org/issue/62047\n\nI can send a new CL in a bit.",
