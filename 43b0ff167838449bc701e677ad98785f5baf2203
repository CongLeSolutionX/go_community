      "message": "I don\u0027t think this works.\n\nThe getg() function is inlined by the compiler as a register load. If the signal interrupts a foreign thread running non-Go code, the register may be filled with anything.\n\nIn the current sigtramp assembly, this is handled by calling get_tls, which loads the g register from thread-local storage. Because the TLS slot is reserved for Go by pthread_key_create, it can be relied on by the signal handler on foreign threads.\n\nI think you will need to call get_tls and pass the result as an argument to sigfwdgo.",

      "message": "The getg function on GNU/Linux fetches the value from the TCB using the %gs register.  It should be reliable no matter when a signal occurs.  I don\u0027t think this is an issue today.\n\nHowever, it\u0027s true that there have been discussions about reserving a register to hold g, in which case this definitely would be an issue.",
