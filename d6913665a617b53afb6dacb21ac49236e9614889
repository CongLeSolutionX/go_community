      "message": "Hmmm, this seems unfortunate. This is due to the rsrc symbol being used later? I think we can just record the index of rsrc symbol in PE object loading, convert to sym.Symbol in loadlibfull, like we do for ctxt.Moduledata2.\n\nEventually we want to rewrite addpersrc to new style, but I think we can delay that for now.",

      "message": "I\u0027m also not super passionate about special symbols. But it seems this symbol is special on PE regardless what we do here, because it needs special handling.\n\nCurrently we have a property: before loadlibfull everything uses the loader, after loadlibfull nothing uses the loader. This makes an exception. If more exceptions are made along the way, I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s a good idea.\n\nAlso not dropping the loader makes memory usage measurement less meaningful. At least, drop the loader on non-Windows platforms.",
