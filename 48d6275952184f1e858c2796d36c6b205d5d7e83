      "message": "There\u0027s one usage of WriteToFile, which we plan to remove. ReadFile is the same as robustio.ReadFile, so I figured we\u0027d remove the parts of the package we\u0027re not using anymore in this CL and remove it completely in the next CL. (Though I added Pattern back so maybe the package will stay around just for that...)\n\nWriteToFile is never called, so I figure we should consolidate them? How about \"inlining\" WriteToFile into WriteFile?",
