      "message": "That\u0027s my plan at least. Maybe someone else will contribute wasm32.\n\nIt is simpler because WebAssembly only has 32- and 64-bit integer variables, but no 8- or 16-bit ones. To keep it simple, I currently store integers of all sizes in 64-bit variables only and coerce where necessary. In the future we could evaluate if it makes sense to add 32-bit variables, too.",
