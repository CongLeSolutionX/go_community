      "message": "This looks like a backward-incompatible API change.\n\n`SkipNow` “must be called from the goroutine running the test, not from other goroutines created during the test”. However, `Parallel` has no such restriction, and calls to `Parallel` can (correctly but rarely) occur in other goroutines.\n\nFor example, this change would cause the test function in https://go.dev/play/p/5t19ytbLVVE — which should always pass today! — to instead deadlock if `-failfast` is enabled and some other parallel test fails concurrently.",
