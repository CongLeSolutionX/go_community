      "message": "As I read this there is some confusion as what you mean by increasing and adjusting the alignment because in one case you mean setting the alignment field in the text section\u0027s symbol but later when you talk about adjusting the alignment you mean actually setting the VA start for the section so that agrees with that alignment setting. And if you get to ld.(*Link).address and the VA start is not sufficient for the text section\u0027s alignment, then things can go wrong. This can happen when splitting text sections since new text sections might require alignment greater than their initial starting VA which is not handled correctly now. To fix that you must update the alignment for text sections after the split to the max possible alignment (64B) and round up the start VA to the proper alignment at the time the new text section is created so that it is consistent when it gets to ld.(*Link).address.\n\nI guess I\u0027m trying to restate the problem partly so I understand what it is.",
