      "message": "As I read this there is some confusion as what you mean by increasing and adjusting the alignment because in one case you mean setting the alignment field in the text section\u0027s symbol but later when you talk about adjusting the alignment you mean actually setting the VA start for the section so that agrees with that alignment setting. And if you get to ld.(*Link).address and the VA start is not sufficient for the text section\u0027s alignment, then things can go wrong. This can happen when splitting text sections since new text sections might require alignment greater than their initial starting VA which is not handled correctly now. To fix that you must update the alignment for text sections after the split to the max possible alignment (64B) and round up the start VA to the proper alignment at the time the new text section is created so that it is consistent when it gets to ld.(*Link).address.\n\nI guess I\u0027m trying to restate the problem partly so I understand what it is.",

      "message": "I\u0027m asking you to improve your comment so it is a bit clearer as to what\u0027s happening with regard to the setting of the alignment of the section. Basically if the alignment for the section is increased but the VA for that section is not also updated so it is in sync with that alignment, then bad things will happen. You talk about about increasing and adjusting alignment but in one case you mean the section\u0027s alignment and in the other you mean the alignment of the VA for the section. They are two different things but they sound like the same thing and that\u0027s confusing because then how could they be out of sync.",
