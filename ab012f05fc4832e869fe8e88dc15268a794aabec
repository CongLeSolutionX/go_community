      "message": "Seems simpler to just block SIGPROF using sigprocmask.\n\nBut either way it\u0027s hard for me to be comfortable with this patch.  It sounds like there is a bug with turning off profiling in a c-archive.  I would very much prefer to fix that bug rather than to change the test to hide the bug.  While I assume there are few programs that use a c-archive that does profiling, we shouldn\u0027t expect those programs to know that they need to block SIGPROF in some way.",
