      "message": "This seems to imply that p.Internal.CompilerImports must be a strict superset of the imports from both GoFiles and CompiledGoFiles.\n\nDo we need to take some explicit step to union them here, or does CompilerImports already include that union? (If the latter, the current comment on CompilerImports is very confusing.)\n\nA test case for a package with cgo and non-cgo source files containing distinct import paths would probably help to clarify things.",
