I\u0027m basing this on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20362406/tagged-pointers-in-objective-c , which says that NSNumber is tagged, and https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFDesignConcepts/Articles/tollFreeBridgedTypes.html , which says CFBooleanRef and NSNumber are toll-free bridged types. Playing around with the CFBoolean constructors and constants, it doesn\u0027t seem those are tagged, but maybe as an edge case it might be possible to manufacture a tagged CFBooleanRef?",
