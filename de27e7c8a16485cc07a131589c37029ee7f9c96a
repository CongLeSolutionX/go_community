      "message": "I expect over time that these lowerings will be moved into SSA construction (see also #17728). Append is already handled during SSA, we just moved race/msan instrumentation to SSA, and I think Austin had near-term plans to move range loops to SSA too.\n\nI might move this paragraph into the next section, and just generally mention that for historical reasons, much of the AST-\u003eSSA conversion is still handled by the \"order\" and \"walk\" AST passes that rewrite higher-level AST operations into simpler ones.",
