      "message": "Thanks for this. My only request is a little more explanation in the CL description. What you have is too short and not quite accurate. Be more thorough, but for such a small change it doesn\u0027t need to be too long. Something like this:\n\ncmd/doc: fix inconsistent receiver name\n\nThe ToText method of Package is the only one with a receiver declared \u0027p\u0027; all the rest have \u0027pkg\u0027. Fix it to be consistent.",
