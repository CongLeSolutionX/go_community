      "message": "Can you explain this a bit? What are the situations where two unique packages could have the same import path? Nested modules perhaps?\nWould this cause issues with different major versions? (I would think no, since the import paths would differ)\n\nIf this is something that could come back to bite people, is there a way we can use a unique name here, such as the module+import_path or something?\n\nI agree that we should leave the minor version out this directory, since a new directory for every revision is not going to be helpful.",
