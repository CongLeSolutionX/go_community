Keith and I discussed (briefly) a better approach in one of the comments, that rather than guessing at one-size-fits-enough numbers, would by design avoid inlines that made their caller exceed the inlining threshold (the hoped-for policy is that this would result in inlined-fast-path and inlined top-level allocations).",
