And you mentioned that hand timers off to other P before enter a potentially long unpreemptible section will be more difficult, because it hard determine exactly how long the potentially unpreemptible section will be and at the same time the contention affect will be large.",

Perhaps we could occasionally prefer to steal from stopped Ps over local work as well?",
