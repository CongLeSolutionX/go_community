      "message": "Hoisting these up (so that we don\u0027t have to assume init is safe to call a second time on a reused value) took what used to be a few write barriers per c.lock critical section and made it n*a few for the first call. That caused a wbuf flush, which in turn triggered a static lock ranking failure. I\u0027ve sent out CL 571195 below this one to fix that preexisting rare but now more common failure, rather than continuing to pile into this CL.",
