(I started writing this file with the intent to propose it as an addition to something — io/ioutil or perhaps something in an x/ repo — but then realized that symlink structure we want for filesystem efficiency is not very general.)\n\n\u003e 2) Shouldn\u0027t this line be perm \u003d info.Mode() \u0026 os.ModePerm?  The permission bits of a symlink are ignored.\n\nYes, and I\u0027ve learned something new today!\n\n“All interfaces specified by POSIX.1-2008 shall behave as if the contents of symbolic links can always be read, except that the value of the file mode bits returned in the st_mode field of the stat structure is unspecified.”",
