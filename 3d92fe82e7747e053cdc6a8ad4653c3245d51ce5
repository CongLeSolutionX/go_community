Calling Synopsis on a zero Package (as opposed to a Package loaded from actual Go package sources) does not have info about declarations in that package, and so it cannot handle links correctly.\n\n\nFor example if your package comment says\n\n// Package p provides [Foo].\n\nand Foo is a type defined in package P, then Synopsis should interpret [Foo] as a link to Foo. It will if you use a real, initialized Package\u0027s Synopsis method. It will not if you use the zero Package.",
