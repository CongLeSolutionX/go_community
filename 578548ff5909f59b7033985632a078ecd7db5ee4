(A \"...Locked\" method generally indicates that the method expects some mutex to be held when it is called.)\n\nHow does moving the lock here avoid a deadlock? The CL description says \"affects lock copies\", but I don\u0027t understand what that means and there aren\u0027t any tests demonstrating what is being fixed.",
