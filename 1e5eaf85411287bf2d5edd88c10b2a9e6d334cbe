      "message": "Thanks for sending the change.\n\nI considered it before the release, but found that even after this change there\u0027s one more instance still using nil without being wrapped in \u003ccode\u003e. When I thought about whether it should be updated or not, I started to see that there isn\u0027t a definitively \"consistent\" way.\n\nSometimes \"nil\" is used in the sense of the nil predeclared identifier, other times it\u0027s used as the English word nil meaning zero or nonexistent, and sometimes it\u0027s a suble mix of both. Our previous release notes also had a mixture of these.\n\nIn the the end, I thought the release notes were okay as is and I needed to focus on the rest of the release process, so I didn\u0027t have time to write this comment then.\n\nThe other inconsistencies you\u0027ve fixed were very helpful and I appreciate your attention to detail, thank you.",
