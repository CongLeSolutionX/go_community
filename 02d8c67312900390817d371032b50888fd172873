      "message": "OK, this check is still incorrect since AT_EACCESS is handled by syscall.Faccessat internally and so it works on older kernel, too.\n\nNeed to call faccessat2 directly here, and I\u0027m not sure how to do that without doing one of the following:\n1. Make const syscall._SYS_faccessat2 public; or\n2. Make func syscall.Faccessat2 public; or\n3. Duplicate the value of SYS_faccessat2 in internal/syscall/unix.\n\nTo me it seems that the first approach is the best (not too intrusive and avoid duplication), yet it\u0027s still a syscall API change so needs an approval.\n\nWe could also do something like\n\n4. Define public SYS_faccessat in internal/syscall/unix, so it can be used by the test, and have syscall use it as `_SYS_faccessat \u003d unix.SYS_faccessat`\n\n...but this is impossible since internal/syscall/unix depends on syscall and not vice versa.\n\nYet another way is to\n\n5. Introduce an internal `force_faccessat2` Linux-specific flag, honored by syscall.Faccessat, and use it in this test.\n\nThis approach, while doable, seems really ugly to me.",

      "message": "Generally, this is not a good way (due to vendor kernels backporting new features) but I guess for a test case it is acceptable since the worst case scenario is a skipped test that could\u0027ve been run...\n\nExcept for the case when a new kernel is used, but the container in which the test is running have old(er) seccomp configuration which does not allow faccessat2. This has happened in the past; this is why in a few places we check for ENOSYS and EPERM (the latter is returned by old seccomp ruleset; it was changed to ENOSYS for unknown syscalls lately to not confuse e.g. glibc\u0027s fallback codepaths).\n\nLet\u0027s see if the above is practically a problem for the existing CI.",
