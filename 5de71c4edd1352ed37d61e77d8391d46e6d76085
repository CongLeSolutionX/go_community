      "message": "FWIW, I think it would be helpful to have some comments broadly explaining what these different adjustments represent, and when they apply.\n\nLike panicPathAdj, initFuncAdj, and inLoopAdj I think are based on the lexical context around the call site.\n\npassFooToBar seem to be about when a call involves an argument with property Foo that gets passed to a function where the parameter gets used with property Bar.\n\nreturnFeedsFooToBar seems to be the opposite: a caller returns a value with property Foo, which later its uses have property Bar.",
