      "message": "It seems to me that if we add support for ios/amd64, we would still want a method like this to report true for ios/amd64.  If the iOS simulator should act differently in some way, I think we should key off that, rather than \n\nI know you know this, but the only reason the arm64 is in there is that before we used to say darwin/386 and darwin/amd64 are regular macOS, while darwin/arm and darwin/arm64 are iOS.  Then we dropped darwin/arm.  Then we added goos \u003d\u003d \"ios\".  The \"arm64\" is left over from when we were using GOARCH to separate macOS and iOS.  I can\u0027t see any clear reason why, after adding \"ios\", we would still want to check \"arm64\".\n\nIf the iOS simulator should act differently in some way, I think we should have some way to mark the simulator, rather than continuing to differentiate based on GOARCH.",
