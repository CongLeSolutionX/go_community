      "message": "Notably, this slice seems particularly wrong.  The relevant types are:\n\n  type RawSockaddr struct {\n          Family uint16\n          Data   [14]int8\n  }\n\n  type RawSockaddrInet4 struct {\n          Family uint16\n          Port   uint16\n          Addr   [4]byte /* in_addr */\n          Zero   [8]uint8\n  }\n\n  type RawSockaddrInet6 struct {\n          Family   uint16\n          Port     uint16\n          Flowinfo uint32\n          Addr     [16]byte /* in6_addr */\n          Scope_id uint32\n  }\n\nSo Data[2:] does point to Addr for Inet4, but it points to Flowinfo for Inet6.  Even if it was Data[6:], it would be a slice of only 8 bytes, so bytesEqualIP would have panicked do to an out of bounds index.",
