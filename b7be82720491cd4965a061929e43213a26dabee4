The fix (along with a future one in x/net/http2) are meant to solve a particular pain point for me. I can\u0027t wait to hear your feedback and begin the path to becoming a community member!\n\nThanks!",

(We will be maintaining those APIs for as long as Go 1 exists, so we are very careful about what we add!) https://github.com/golang/proposal#the-proposal-process\n\nJust to set expectations, a proposal getting kicked off now won\u0027t make it for the Go 1.19 code freeze that\u0027s happening in a week, but can comfortably make it for Go 1.20.",

      "message": "Thank you for the quick review and response! I completely understand about the API process and thought we would have to do that. I realize that this is a fairly big hammer to pound what is, admittedly, a very small nail. However, I have spent a long time thinking about the best solution and, looking long term, this approach seems like it is the best. \n\nThat said, I am going to continue looking for ways that I could patch x/net/http2 without having to make an API change. \n\nI\u0027d love your thoughts!\n\nThanks again for the review!",
