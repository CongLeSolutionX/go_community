      "message": "I think Nehal is correct that there *is* a problem with this test. The `cc` command in this test uses the `cc` script builtin (added in CL 154109), not the `cc` executable resolved from $PATH. If it did use an executable from $PATH, then it would fail to pass appropriate flags when `$GOARCH` doesn\u0027t match the default architecture chosen by `$(which cc)`.\n\nSo I think we do need to continue using the `cc` builtin for this test, and we do need to skip the test under the `[!cgo]` condition, because that condition indicates that the `cc` builtin is unavailable. But this rationale in the commit message should refer to the `cc` builtin, not the validity of the path indicated by the `CC` environment variable in general.\n\nI also think it would be clearer for the `cc` builtin to explicitly fail (with a useful failure message) when cgo is not enabled.",
