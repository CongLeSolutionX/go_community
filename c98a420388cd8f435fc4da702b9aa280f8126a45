      "message": "NOTE FOR REVIEW: This change is not strictly necessary: we must tolerate incompatible versions elsewhere because the proxy may return them. There\u0027s also a performance cost: we may need to do a shallow clone of these versions when we might otherwise get away with \u0027git ls-remote\u0027 only. Heschi argues we shouldn\u0027t do this. I think it\u0027s better to avoid introducing incompatible versions though.\n\nLet me know what you think. If we decide to keep this, I\u0027ll add a test.",
