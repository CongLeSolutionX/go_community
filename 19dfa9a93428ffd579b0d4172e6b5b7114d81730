How about\n\nIt is only updates that are unsafe.\nAs long as all goroutines are only reading—looking up elements in the map,\nincluding iterating through it using a\n\u003ccode\u003efor\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003erange\u003c/code\u003e loop—and not changing the map\nby assigning to elements or doing deletions,\nit is safe for them to access the map\nconcurrently without synchronization.",
