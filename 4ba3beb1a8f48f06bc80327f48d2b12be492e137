The cmd/internal/objfile package is, of course, an internal package that is only used by the various Go tools.  Just adding the fields to cmd/internal/objfile doesn\u0027t do anything by itself.  What\u0027s the next step here?\n",

      "message": "The symbols go directly into https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/objdump, which is an external developer command, and one that I use pretty frequently now that I\u0027m exploring ELF/DWARF as parsed by Go (and building my own tools). The next step would be to expose those variables there, which I think would be fairly useful, at least for my niche use case.",

      "message": "All objdump does is disassemble code.  It doesn\u0027t display symbol information.  We aren\u0027t going to be adding functionality to objdump.\n\nobjdump is also not ELF-specific, and the information you are adding is at least partially ELF-specific.\n\nFor handling ELF information, or more generally anything other than disassembly, I think it would make more sense to write your own tool that uses debug/elf and friends.  You can start with your own copy of cmd/internal/objfile if you find that to be useful.  We don\u0027t want to maintain code in cmd/internal/objfile that isn\u0027t going to be used by any of the tools in cmd.\n\nThanks.",
