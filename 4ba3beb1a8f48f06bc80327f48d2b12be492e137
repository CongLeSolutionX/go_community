The cmd/internal/objfile package is, of course, an internal package that is only used by the various Go tools.  Just adding the fields to cmd/internal/objfile doesn\u0027t do anything by itself.  What\u0027s the next step here?\n",

The next step would be to expose those variables there, which I think would be fairly useful, at least for my niche use case.",
