I am ever so slightly bugged by these repeated constants floating around, but they are pretty close to each other.  Could use const defaultMinTriggerRatio \u003d 0.6; const fudgedMaxTriggerMultiplier \u003d 0.95; something like that, but perhaps that is too much.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t feel great about multiplying the maxTriggerRatio by 0.6 since that doesn\u0027t really have that much meaning (thought it does work, and it is close; that being said, it does matter here because I want to backport this, so the behavior for GOGC\u003d\u003e\u003d100 should be identical). I\u0027d rather break out float64(gcpercent) / 100 and turn that into a \"scaling factor\" and then the constants only appear in one place. how do you feel about that?",
