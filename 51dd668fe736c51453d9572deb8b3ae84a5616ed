Thus, there is a small\n\t// difference between the size of this section and the sum of\n\t// its symbols\u0027 size which we are currently using.\n\t// However, in external linking, we are merging all .text sections\n\t// in a single csect. Thus, we can use the sum of the sections\u0027\n\t// size instead of the sum of the size all the section\u0027s symbols.\n\t// NOTE: This won\u0027t work anymore once external linking generation\n\t// as been fixed (cf TODO in writeSymbolFunc).\n\tif ctxt.LinkMode \u003d\u003d LinkExternal {\n\t\tcurrSymSrcFile.csectSize \u003d 0\n\t\tfor _, s :\u003d range Segtext.Sections {\n\t\t\tif s.Name !\u003d \".text\" {\n\t\t\t\tbreak\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcurrSymSrcFile.csectSize +\u003d int64(s.Length)\n\t\t}\n\t}",
