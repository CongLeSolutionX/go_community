      "message": "Many of the cases where this code is called have a maximum length, but that maximum is lost when calling this function.  That is, when calling syscall.UTF16ToString many of the uses pass a slice of, say, 256 characters.  Here we are just getting a pointer.  In some cases it seems at least possible that the null terminator is not present.  I think it would be safer if we passed a maximum length here.",
