We\u0027re using the SymbolUpdater call\u0027s side effect of allowing symbols to be updated. In any case, I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll be widespread in the codebase, but just expressing my general \"ugh\" feeling here.",

      "message": "Yeah, I also thought about this when I did the rewrite. Seems a little weird at first. On the other hand it kind of makes sense: make an updater, so we can update the symbol, as it sounds. Maybe we could do it unconditionally -- if s is external, MakeSymbolUpdater is pretty cheap.",
