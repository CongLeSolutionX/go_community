I suggest you set\n\nexport ZONEINFO\u003d$GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip\n\nbefore running your command. This should force it to use $GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip for zone locations. $GOROOT/lib/time/zoneinfo.zip is the same for everyone. It is also has been updated recently. so it should be good enough.",
