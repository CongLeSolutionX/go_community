      "message": "The rationale in #25911 was ‚Äúto save time/space‚Äù, but I don\u0027t see any measurements of how much time \u0026 space is actually spent on linking and running the test packages.\n\nThe rationale in #35220 was ‚Äúwhy is the linker being built for js/wasm?‚Äù, but that seems like more of a rhetorical question than a rationale. ü§î\n\nOn the one hand, it\u0027s true that we don\u0027t actually run `cmd` executables on the host. On the other hand, it would be nice if `go test std cmd` could be relied upon to test all `GOOS`/`GOARCH` combinations.",
