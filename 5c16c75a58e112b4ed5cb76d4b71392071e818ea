      "message": "FYI, I\u0027m a little skeptical of separating inline, escape, and walk. E.g., we\u0027ve talked about wanting to interleave inline and escape, so inline can make escape-aware optimizing decisions; or doing all of them in a single bottom-up traversal.\n\nBut maybe I\u0027m just overly accustomed to working in the cmd/compile mono-package and fine-grained packages will be fine. I\u0027m happy to give it a shot. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll want to fine-tune package boundaries over time as we gain experience anyway.",
