Does it need to be regenerated (and added to this CL)? How does this compile?\n\nWhen I comment these two constants out, the go vet crash we\u0027ve been seeing (see also issue #20837) disappears.\n\nThere\u0027s still a bug in go/tyes (it shouldn\u0027t crash), but it seems to me there\u0027s something odd with this CL as well.",
