      "message": "\u003e This test passes for me today. What are we testing here?\n\nDo you mean \"go test ./misc/cgo/test\" passes today? This test case is really for \"go test -run Cgo go/internal/srcimporter\", which checks that go/types and go/internal/srcimporter can successfully use cmd/cgo and UsesCgo mode to import and typecheck this directory too.\n\nI can add a comment explaining this.\n\n\u003e Can we also add a test to misc/testgodefs/testdata, something that tests that C type winds up with the expected name?\n\nDo you mind clarifying what you have in mind here? I\u0027m happy to add more tests, but I\u0027m afraid I\u0027m not sure I follow exactly what you think should be tested.\n\nDo you mean just add a similar #define test within testgodefs, and then check that we\u0027re able to use it in main.go as expected?",

A comment would help.\n\nFor godefs I mean something like add a test to testgodefs that works today with a #define of a type, and make sure it still works.  Thanks.",
