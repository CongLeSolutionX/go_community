Do you have another suggestion for gomobile version now that neither go install -x -n nor go list -f \u0027{{.Stale}}\u0027 works?\n\nThis complication also renders the need for this CL to go into 1.10.1 moot.",

      "message": "The \"gomobile bind\" subcommand generates source code that in turn depend on support packages and files in golang.org/x/mobile/bind. The generated code and the golang.org/x/mobile packages must match, and so it is useful to detect whether the gomobile executable matches whatever is checked out in $GOPATH/src/golang.org/x/mobile.\n\nCurrently, only the \"gomobile version\" subcommand checks this but I would like to use the check every time \"gomobile bind\" is invoked.\n\nWithout \"go install -x -n\" or \"go list -f \u0027{{.Stale}}\u0027\" I\u0027m not sure how to proceed. I could detect the single \"rm -r ...\" line but that seems too unreliable. I could leave out the -n flag from the go install command but I don\u0027t think a rebuild of the running command (gomobile) will always work or be desired, in particular on Windows.",
