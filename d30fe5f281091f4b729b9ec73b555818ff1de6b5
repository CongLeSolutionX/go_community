      "message": "Hmmm, OK, I thought this was a general problem, but I guess the T(x) conversion is only a problem if we actually need to do a real conversion underneath in the compiler (like converting a slice to a pointer to array, not just converting between two similar pointer types).  So, I guess there are no other such notable conversions with the destination being a pointer to type?\n\nAs I was mentioning in the bug, we could possibly add an extra flag to Shapify() to indicate if any T(x) (or even more specifically, T(x) conversions involving slice/array) are in the instantiation.  But, I agree, probably not worth it, if this is the only possible conversion that can cause a problem.",
