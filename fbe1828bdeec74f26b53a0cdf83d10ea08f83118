      "message": "\"you must have completed\" sounds to me a bit \"bureaucratic\" or \u0027dictatorial\" and somehow reminds of the government paperwork :) - Maybe this would sound better: \"you need to complete one of the contributor license agreements\".  Of course in the end you still need to submit the CLA, but I believe the tone would be more inviting / friendly and more in line with the image of that nice Gopher mascot or the adorable squishable gophers :))  \"you need to\" is also in the current text.\n\n(sorry if I\u0027m bikeshedding little things)",
