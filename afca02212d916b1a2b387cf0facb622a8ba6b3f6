      "message": "I can not make errorcheck work with pragmas since they have to be on the same line. This workaround is only here for demonstration since i could not see a way to make testing the errors work with errorcheck otherwise. Seems like errorcheck has to first be extended in a way to put the matching error on a different line so this work around will not be needed.\n\nOther path going forward would be to submit a version of this CL only with the tests added in lex_test.go.",
