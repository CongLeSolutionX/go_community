      "message": "Thank you for this CL, however the go/types package does this style of assertion in a lot of places. As a matter of style, it does not differentiate between a typed nil and an unknown type, effectively removing typed nils from the \u0027Type\u0027 union, which simplifies the code conceptually. Admittedly it takes some getting used to.\n\nUnless there is a reason for breaking this style, I don\u0027t think we should make this change, so I am going to -2 (this is a matter of procedure: out of context this change is reasonable, so I am using this to make sure it isn\u0027t accidentally approved and merged).\n\nWe should perhaps add some commentary about the go/types internal style.",
