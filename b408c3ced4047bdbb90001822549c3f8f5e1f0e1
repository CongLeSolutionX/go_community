      "message": "Indeed and i had made a bigger local commit that contains that already :)\n\nThere will be more changes in this part of the code. e.g. bit size tests. I just try to do not to much at once as there are many different cleanups and features and some changes require earlier commits to get in first so i have not uploaded/broken up all of it into smaller CLs yet.\n\nThanks for review. If you want i can add you directly to all the other related changes.",
