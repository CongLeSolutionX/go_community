      "message": "I am not sure this is entirely accurate. Not all flagops are used to pass the carry op. I suspect this may incorrectly classify unrelated opcodes as carry ops.\n\nOn PPC64, the opcode is used to identify whether and how the carry bit is used.\n\nIt gets a little more tricky when the carry is architecturally part of the flags. On my WIP for amd64, I had to create new opcodes to avoid optimizations which led to cases with multiple live flag values.\n\nHow difficult would it be to save flags to a gpr instead of regenerating them if the latter is more expensive? It doesn\u0027t take too many instructions before that becomes more desirable on PPC64. I am not sure about others.",
