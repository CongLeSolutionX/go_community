      "message": "The script test environment has a test-local module proxy implementation â€” let\u0027s use that, and then we don\u0027t need to skip this test in short mode.\n\n(Since the `go build` command in this test doesn\u0027t actually end up building anything, it shouldn\u0027t be very expensive.)\n\nThat would be something like:\n```\n# \u0027go build\u0027 of a main package path should not resolve a module for that path,\n# even if -mod\u003dmod is set.\n! go build -mod\u003dmod -o printversion.exe example.com/printversion\nstderr \u0027^go: cannot find module providing package github.com/some/go/tool: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see \u0027\u0027go help modules\u0027\u0027$\u0027\n```\n\nActually, come to think of it, `src/cmd/go/testdata/script/mod_outside.txt` already has a bunch of cases that execute `go build`, and this one would fit nicely there (around line 173). So please add the above command to that test and delete this file. ðŸ™ƒ",
