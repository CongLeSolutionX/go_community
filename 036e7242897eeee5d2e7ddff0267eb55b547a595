      "message": "This is the bug-fix. The check against `module.CanonicalVersion` caused `Versions` to retain and report tags like `v2.0.0+incompatible`, but then `Stat` couldn\u0027t resolve them because it was looking for a tag like `v2.0.0` (without the suffix).\n\nOne possible fix would be to make `Stat` look for the literal tag, but that would be confusing because `go get â€¦@v2.0.0+incompatible` could potentially refer to two different commits.\n\nSo the fix I\u0027ve chosen here is to instead strip those tags out of the version list.",
