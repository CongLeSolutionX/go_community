      "message": "This CL is just a framework of new assembler, plus an xml parser. Since it doesn\u0027t change any encoding implementation, and no new instructions are added, so it does not actually depend on the refactoring of Addr. However, the instruction encoding implementation based on this CL relies on the refactoring of Addr. Because there are multiple CLs that depend on this CL, so I make this CL based on the refactoring CLs of Addr, so that subsequent CLs only need to be based on this CL. That\u0027s it. \n\nI think the Addr refactoring is very good, it brings a lot of convenience to the encoding work of elements.",

      "message": "It means that the format of Go arm64 assembly instructions is not well defined. It contains two situations:\n1. The opcode is not well defined.\n2. The operand order is not well defined.\n\nThe instruction table https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/424137/13/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/instructions.go\nalso defines the opcode and operand order of an arm64 instruction in Go. This is based on the guidance of this document https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/424137/13/src/cmd/internal/obj/arm64/doc.go.\n\nI\u0027m a bit worried that some of the instructions may not be well defined because I didn\u0027t check the format of all instructions one by one. For example, I have always felt that the order of operands in the MADD series of multiply-accumulate instructions is \"unreasonable\". So I added this table to manually control the supported instructions so that we don\u0027t suddenly find that the syntax of a certain instruction is very weird in the future.\n\nOf course, I think there should be no problem with the definition of most instructions. In addition, it only affects the syntax of the instructions and does not affect the correctness. If you think it is unnecessary, we can remove this table. Maybe in the future, if I have time, I will check the supported instruction one by one. If there is no problem, I will delete this table.",

This has quite some code that are only needed for generating files and not needed by the rest of the standard library, so maybe x/arch is probably a better place for this. Also, maybe later we can extend this to also generate the disassembler, which also lives in the x/arch repo.",
