      "message": "This is different behaviour to before.\nOld contents beyond len() reappeared as they were appended(),\nnow it\u0027s zero bytes;  I don\u0027t know if that matters.\nThe sum here is the same as the other regalloc.go diff:\n    n-len()+1\nbut there n was an index and here it\u0027s a new size, a len,\nso differs by 1 thus the same sum smells wrong.\nn\u003d5 len\u003d2 gives 4 which is correct for an index n as it\nadds indexes 2,3,4,5 allowing [n].\nBut when n is a desired len, as here, no +1 is required.\nIt\u0027s making the cap() step too high unnecessarily with the\nlast element unused.\nIf it was correct, would the next line be required?",
