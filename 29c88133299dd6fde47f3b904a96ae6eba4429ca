For now, let\u0027s just have test/run.go add it for errorcheck (and errorcheckandfoo) tests.\n\nAlso, as a followup CL, we should remove all the -d\u003dpanic lines added to tests by the previous CLs. But we should wait a day or two to make sure all the builders are okay, in case we need to revert any CLs.",
