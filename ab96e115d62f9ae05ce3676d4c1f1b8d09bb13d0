      "message": "I have a suspicion this flexibility is unnecessary, and we can just unconditionally ignore pointers to not-in-heap types. The only reason identifying pointer-containing types is interesting to the compiler is because it affects GC, but the entire point of not-in-heap types is knowing they\u0027re never relevant to GC.\n\nPut differently: my understanding is pointer-to-notinheap-type is no different from uintptr, except it allows *p and p.f as syntactic sugar.\n\nAm I overlooking anything?",

For example, it\u0027s used in assignment ordering and in escape analysis, I believe just to understand what the object graph can look like.",
