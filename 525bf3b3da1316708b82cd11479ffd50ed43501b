      "message": "my gut reaction was that this could lead to a deadlock because these locks aren\u0027t ordered, but I think there\u0027s actually an implicit ordering here since a destroyed P will always have a higher ID than the P you\u0027re putting this into. a comment about that would be nice but...\n\nthis is happening during STW anyway, so I\u0027m not sure that even matters at all. maybe it\u0027s even fine to just not use the locks at all?",
