      "message": "For structure comparisons that are inlined by walk/compare.go, there is a performance improvement for cases where the size isnâ€™t a power of 2. Previously it called a runtime.memequal function which is a way slower than using 2-3 cmp instructions inline.\n\n\nFor structure comparison functions that are generated with reflectdata/alg.go we can notice a performance improvement even for cases where simplified versions of memequal are used (memequal{1/2/4/8/16}), since the geneq function is called after the inlining stage, memequal{1/2/4/8/16}, were not inlined so there were extra calls.",
