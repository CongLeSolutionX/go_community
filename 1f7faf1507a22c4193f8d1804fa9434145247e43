I did not suggest to\nreplace sort.SearchInts(s, 7) which is found, but to add\none (or two) more calls to sort.SearchInts in the example.\n\nMore like\n\n    s :\u003d []int{4, 7, 9} // The slice must be sorted in ascending order.\n    fmt.Println(sort.SearchInts(s, 7))  // 7 is present in s at index 1\n    fmt.Println(sort.SearchInts(s, 8))  // 8 is not present and would go to  index 2\n    fmt.Println(sort.SearchInts(s, 15))  // 15 is not present and would go to  index 3\n    // Output:\n    // 1\n    // 2\n    // 3\n\nAs SearchInts has two major modes (found and not found) an example\nshould show both modes IMHO.",
