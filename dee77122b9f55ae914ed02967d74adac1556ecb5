      "message": "\u003cnon-urgent CL\u003e\n\nhttp://golang.org/cl/353136 attempts to add a compile-time assertion on the size of a structure with unsafe.Sizeof (in os_linux.go). This chokes cmd/api, which as-is will use the arch-specific struct definition but always with the amd64 integral sizes (the default when Sizes is not set).\n\nWhether or not that CL should remain as-is, IMO it makes sense that we should type-check with the appropriate arch sizes. This actually makes the API output more accurate as constants will show their true value, but does introduce a diff from the existing API files.\n\nWhat do y\u0027all think of making this change? If so, should I fold the API \"changes\" into next.txt, or perhaps ex-post-facto into the go1.N.txt files where they were first introduced?",
