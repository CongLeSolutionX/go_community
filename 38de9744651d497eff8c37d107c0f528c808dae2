      "message": "I think most of the uses of m.traceback can be eliminated now that throw includes all runtime detail, including the one in gcMarkTermination. I\u0027m least sure about the ones in mprof.go, since those *aren\u0027t* throws, but just implicit communication to the traceback functions. Those seem really weird to me, because if we do throw while in one of those functions, the runtime will get confused about how much detail to include. That suggests that m.traceback should be the throwType enum and we should take the max here, since a real throw would push that max up. This is all pretty messy. Or these should be flags to traceback rather than implicit state, but that\u0027s a much bigger change.",
