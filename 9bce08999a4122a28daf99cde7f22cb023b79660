      "message": "This is causing OOMs on several of the post-submit builders.\n\nMoreover, end users may run these tests as part of `go test all` in their own modules, and we have no particular reason to believe that their machines are any less memory-constrained than our builders.\n\nI think this approach needs to be rethought. Perhaps we could use `testing.Short()` instead, so that the \"big\" tests only run on the `-longtest` builders and for users who aren\u0027t passing the `-short` flag?\n\nIf the test really requires that much memory, we may also want to make it conditional on having a 64-bit address space. Many (but not all) of the failing builders are 32-bit platforms.",
