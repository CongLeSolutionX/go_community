      "message": "(nit) This assumes that the user running the `go` command now is the same as the one who originally created the directory.\n\nThat does seem likely to be true almost all the time, but it is theoretically possible for multiple users (say, within the same group) to share a module cache, and if one user downloads the toolchain module a second user might not be able to successfully fix it up.\n\nI think that situation is unlikely enough not to worry about, but it might be good to leave a comment here in case we\u0027re wrong about that.",
