      "message": "A large portion of the time spent sorting is cache misses, and inlining the fields gives better cache behaviour.\nNow that i think about it maybe there is something that can be done to stdlib sort that would make this better?\nIn the meantime i\u0027ll leave this if that is ok?",

      "message": "Ah, then long term there\u0027s a tradeoff here. If cmd/link moves to using slices for everything, then list2Slice below would be a no-op if dataSlice is a []*LSym.\n\nWith a large enough number of elements, I suspect an optimization like this would still win, but you may not be able to measure it in cmd/go any more.\n\nOverall I\u0027m fine with this, but let\u0027s give it until monday morning on the west coast and see if there are any other opinions.",
