      "message": "I agree. The best I was able to do prior was to factor out common functions (namedValueToValue) and put in a common file (ctxutil.go), but, I\u0027m not sure how to preserve the general structure and still call the correct functions. Maybe this is a case for some form of generics. I\u0027m not sure how to improve this though, unless you think I should put the similar code back in ctxutil.go so it is together again.",
