When we link the binary, we have all the symbols it needs.\n\nEven if they did, all the copying would happen when the main program starts, long before a plugin is loaded. The plugin itself will use the symbol as laid down.\n\nIt is even OK if the main binary uses position-dependent code, as long as it properly exports all the symbols the plugin might need.",
