      "message": "See my earlier comment. \"returns an error\" is misleading as testing.Short only returns a bool. What it actually does is write to stderr and call os.Exit(2), which is all that panic does anyway. So this just crashes with nicer formatting than it did before, which I don\u0027t think is worth calling out. It\u0027s a fringe failure more anyway. (Normal tests don\u0027t require a flag.Parse.. only if you use testing.Main, which is rare)\n\nSo I\u0027d just delete this probably, but you can see what others think if you\u0027re on the fence yourself.",
