Certain parsing implementations will tolerate this invalid encoding (notably OpenSSL), but the Go implementation is generally stricter in these cases. The code you are using to produce CSRs should be fixed to produce a valid encoding of CSRs that lack any attributes.",

PKCS#10 explicitly chose, for whatever reason, to not mark the attributes field as optional, and so it is required to be present, even if empty.\n\nOpenSSL added their exception quite a while ago, when there were a number of broken implementations which got this wrong. That is no longer the case, and as far as I am aware there are no major implementations that still get this wrong.",
