      "message": "That code was added by David in CL 19471.\nI don\u0027t see the point in it now, 8 years later, sorry ðŸ˜ž\n\nWe do have to be careful not to equate a bucket type with a user\u0027s type with the same layout. But the first two conditions do that, so I\u0027m not sure what else this code is defending against.\n\nWe will have situations like\n\ntype A map[int]int\ntype B map[int]int\n\nBoth A and B will share a bucket type, and that bucket type will have a pointer back to just one of those two types. Maybe that is somehow relevant?",
