      "message": "I ran an allocation microbenchmark for an allocation size that would hit this path often. profiles seem to indicate this path was ~0.1% of cycles (absolutely dwarfed by just zeroing that memory) even if all we\u0027re doing is allocating.\n\nwe can drop this CL if you think it\u0027s not worth it. it still feels a little weird to be doing float operations but that might just be me. (IIRC doing float operations in the runtime does have the potential to interfere in tight float64 code that ends up deeply pipelined in the hardware, but allocation is such a big operation that I doubt it actually makes any difference.)",
