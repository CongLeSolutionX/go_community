Maybe not if we intrinsify MulUintptr, as we don\u0027t have rules to fold into those instructions, but if we don\u0027t intrinsify then MulUintptr gets inlined and constant-folded away.\nIt would be better to make it dependent somehow.  Load the args from memory, or use the result as input in the next iteration.",

But sounds like an opportunity for a future optimization :)\n\nWe can load x and y from globals to make sure this is not optimized away in the future.",
