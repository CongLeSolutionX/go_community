Maybe not if we intrinsify MulUintptr, as we don\u0027t have rules to fold into those instructions, but if we don\u0027t intrinsify then MulUintptr gets inlined and constant-folded away.\nIt would be better to make it dependent somehow.  Load the args from memory, or use the result as input in the next iteration.",
