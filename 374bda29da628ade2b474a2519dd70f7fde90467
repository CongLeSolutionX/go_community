      "message": "Andrew, please take another look if you have more comments, otherwise I plan to submit this tonight/tomorrow morning.\n\nCurrently our thinking is to include this in 1.18, but _not_ backport to 1.16 and 1.17, as most uses (i.e., Setuid and other indirect AllThreadsSyscall calls) can workaround the issue by building with cgo (CGO_ENABLED\u003d1). That keeps a risky change (either mine or yours) out of backport risk, but also a fully-fixed version will be released soon with 1.18.",
