      "message": "When I read this commit message I didn\u0027t realize you had made major changes to the code in addition to updating the interfaces and adding BE support. The headline sounds like you are just changing the interfaces. The commit message needs more description of the changes you made to the code and why they help to improve performance. Unfortunately since you also removed the comments lots of lines show up as different when they aren\u0027t. This could be split into 3 changes so it is easier to tell what belongs with what change.",

      "message": "The structure holding the expanded keys is a little different in the generic asm. Thus, we can\u0027t escape non-trivial changes to the ppc64le aes block and cbc ciphers.\n\nThe new cbc implementation should be substantially easier to understand now. PS3 further simplifies it (taking some tricks from amd64).",
