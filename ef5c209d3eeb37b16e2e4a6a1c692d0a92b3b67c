      "message": "This is great!\n\nMy one concern is people who haven\u0027t upgraded their dependency on frugal, but have updated their version of Go. I want the ecosystem to move forward and for package authors to have an incentive to move off these linknames, so I do think this is the right thing to do, but I wanted to put that out there.\n\nI\u0027m not sure whether our original linkname analysis was version-aware. If not, then this is no different than when we started locking down linkname. But if it was.. we may need to at least report a useful error telling users what to upgrade.",
