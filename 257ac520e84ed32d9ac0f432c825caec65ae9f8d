The test was easy enough to write, now I am a bit unsure how best to go about explaining it in clearer terms and would appreciate it if you could give me feedback before I submit another commit.\n\nThe current iteration is:\nTo test whether the process actually exists, a 0-signal (see syscall package) can be sent to the process. This returns an error if the process is not alive. No signal is actually forwarded to the process.\n\nPlease let me know is this is more along the lines of what you would like to see.",
