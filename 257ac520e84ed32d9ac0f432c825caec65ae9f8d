      "message": "Thank you for your feedback. The test was easy enough to write, now I am a bit unsure how best to go about explaining it in clearer terms and would appreciate it if you could give me feedback before I submit another commit.\n\nThe current iteration is:\nTo test whether the process actually exists, a 0-signal (see syscall package) can be sent to the process. This returns an error if the process is not alive. No signal is actually forwarded to the process.\n\nPlease let me know is this is more along the lines of what you would like to see.",

Adding to that, the proposed line does not inform the user that no signal is actually sent (seeing how quit-happy most signals are, that was at least something I was worried about initially).",

So we can write p.Signal(syscall.Signal(0)) as you suggest.\n\nMy concerns about your text is 1) it doesn\u0027t actually explain what to do (the syscall package does not define a \"0-signal\"); 2) it uses unnecessary passive voice (\"can be sent\"); 3) it\u0027s longer than necessary.\n\nThanks.",
