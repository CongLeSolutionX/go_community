      "message": "Thanks for updating the CL description. But I\u0027m still confused, sorry. Before and after this CL, \"expand call\" runs before \"late opt\". This CL moves it across \"decompose builtin\" and \"softfloat\". \"softfloat\" probably doesn\u0027t matter, as I guess you\u0027re not looking at a softfloat platform. That leaves \"decompose builtin\". Why that pass matters? Thanks...",

      "message": "At this distance, I am not 100% sure why this change made the difference; it may be that there is an interaction.  The other possibility is that there was a mistake somewhere in the several refactorings, and expandCalls use to run after late opt, but accidentally got put before (and I did not notice and did not check that it was still missing the optimization).\n\nLong run, this is all moot, since we decided to make it able to run in several places and it gets moved again in a later CL (but moved to places where some of the intermediate CLs would fail).",
