      "message": "I think this is great because it simplifies the context during testing.\n\nPreviously, GOROOT_FINAL had one meaning/effect normally (as documented) and a completely different meaning/effect during tests run by dist test.\n\nNow, only the tests that need to concern with GOROOT_FINAL do so (where it\u0027s more clear why from the context of the test), instead of each test executed by dist test potentially implicitly depending on GOROOT_FINAL being unset and it being unclear if that\u0027s the case.\n\nIt\u0027s also great that it removes the need for GOROOT_FINAL_OLD env var. (One test was already relying on it!)\n\nI\u0027m happy to see it was feasible to pull off this change. Thank you Bryan. üëè\n\nI was torn on whether to suggest leaving some sort of comment here to reduce the chance of this being reverted, but I don\u0027t think such a comment could be effective, so I\u0027ll just hope it doesn\u0027t come back (without a really good reason).",

Someone would have to be pretty motivated to bring this back (other than by a clean revert), and that would break at least one test in cmd/go (so it would at least explain why we\u0027re no longer doing that when they go to run the tests).",
