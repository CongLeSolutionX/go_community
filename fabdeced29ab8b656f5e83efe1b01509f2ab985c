      "message": "`closeAfterStart` is clear about what happens to the file descriptors, but not about what they actually represent: it doesn\u0027t help someone making a change to the package figure out which descriptors need to be closed when.\n\nIt\u0027s also not clear about the (fairly deep) aliasing invariants between `childFiles` and `closeAfterStart`. (I was about to suggest renaming `closeAfterStart` to `childIOFiles`, since it is the files allocated for I/O streams, but then realized that the existing field named `childFiles` is named confusingly close to that!)\n\nIronically, as I was writing this comment I realized that the `childFiles` field appears to serve no real purpose: the other fields of the `Cmd` struct already prevent any finalizers from running for `Stdin`, `Stdout`, `Stderr`, and `ExtraFiles`, and the only other files in the `childFiles` slice are the ones listed in `closeAfterStart` (for which the finalizers have no effect). I have removed that field as a further cleanup.\n\nI\u0027ve now renamed `closeafterStart` to `childIOFiles` (meaning “files passed as the child\u0027s I/O streams”), and `closeAfterWait` to `parentIOPipes` (which really does contain only pipes or wrappers around pipes), and added comments for both of those fields.",
