For instance, *struct{uint32} and *uint32.\n\nAlso, in the compiler type identity isn\u0027t pointer equality. The same program type might be represented several times as different objects (with the same content). See cmd/compile/internal/types/identity.go.\n\nAre there any cases where isSamePtr would have returned true, but this change causes it to return false? (Instrument the compiler for that and run all.bash to see.)",
