      "message": "Is this cpu deltas or alloc deltas? My experience has been that cpu deltas are hard to detect, but that (in the usual case) they track alloc deltas pretty closely. It is thus worth checking and reporting on both. Also object file size changes. I usually start with:\n\ncompilecmp -n 5 -obj\n\nThe first is fast and yields alloc and obj file info, both of which are stable enough that 5 iterations is enough.\n\nAnd then if there\u0027s any reason (empirical or a priori) for concern, I follow up with:\n\ncompilecmp -n 50 -cpu",
