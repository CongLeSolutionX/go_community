      "message": "Something to consider: using sha256.Sum256 is somewhat expensive, on basic inputs this adds ~30Âµs per execution of my machine.\n\nDo we need to include the hash at all? When a target panics we already log it when printing the file name, so it\u0027s somewhat redundant. When a test fails but doesn\u0027t panic, I\u0027m not entirely sure what value the hash provides to the user, since it\u0027s a mutated input there is nothing they can really do with it, or derive from its value. I think the only case where it\u0027s useful is when a seeded input fails, which we can indicate with the test name \"FuzzTarget/seed#N\" which is likely to be more valuable than the hash of the seed.",
