      "message": "It can\u0027t be arbitrarily delayed, because the sysmon thread will still poll the network periodically.\n\nAlso, when a g blocks on netpoll, it increments netpollWaiters in the unlockf function passed to gopark.  So the m will call gopark to stop the g, and then look for more work.  At that point, netpollWaiters \u003e 0, so if there is nothing else to do the m will block in netpoll.\n\nSo as far as I can see this reduces to the behavior we had before.",
