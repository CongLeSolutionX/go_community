(Creation time may be\n\u003e present without access time, for example.)  TSize should equal\n\u003e (1 + 4*(number of set bits in Flags)), as the block is currently\n\u003e defined. Other timestamps may be added in the future.\n\nSince the caller only writes ModTime - should we overwrite the whole field regardless of its size (i.e. potentially loosing previous AcTime or CrTime values)?",
