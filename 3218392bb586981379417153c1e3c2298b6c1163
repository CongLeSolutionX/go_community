      "message": "There is no reliable way to figure out the exact timezone id when loading timezone from arbitrary file. For example, you can hardly know what\u0027s the ID of file \":/etc/mytz\". Actually I\u0027m planning to send another PR to guess the timezone id on its best effort. But this may change the existing behavior as loading timezone from \"/etc/localtime\" is not necessary \"Local\" if it\u0027s a soft link to timezone file located in /usr/share/zoneinfo/xxx, which is now always set to \"Local\" at L42.\n\nIf the break change looks good, I\u0027m also open to add the changes in this PR directly.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should change the current behavior of `time.Local`.  If the user makes no effort to change the timezone, we should return a timezone whose name is `\"Local\"`, as we do today.  Changing that seems sure to break existing programs, so we would need a really good reason.\n\nBut if the user does make an effort to change the timezone, by setting the `TZ` environment, then I think it does not make sense to return a timezone whose name is `\"Local\"`.  There is no particular reason to think that that is the right name in that case.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
