      "message": "Adjusting arbitrary thresholds tends not to turn flaky tests into reliable ones.\n\nGenerally, tests of “condition X ought to hold eventually” can be made both fast and robust by looping (with some sort of backoff) until we actually observe condition X. Then if the test runs on a particularly slow machine, the loop will run a little bit longer rather than producing a flaky failure.",

The previous one _was_ arbitrary whereas this one (except for the +5%) is much less so. If we loop we can probably drop it to 11% or something, just some number strictly greater than 10%.",
