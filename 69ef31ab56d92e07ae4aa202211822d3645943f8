      "message": "PS3 is seeming much more resilient against fuzzing. I was previously finding ~1 crash per 100 test cases. Since restarting the fuzzer with PS3, I\u0027ve only seen 1 crash (I think dup of #43920) in about 1600 runs now.\n\nThe fix also seems reasonable, but as mentioned before, I\u0027m not really familiar with this code. So Keith should probably take a look too.",
