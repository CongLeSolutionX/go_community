Are there any other //go:embed CLs for cmd/compile that are likely to land for Go 1.16?\n\nI\u0027m interested in sync\u0027ing master to dev.regabi and dev.typeparams, and their //go:embed implementations have all diverged somewhat. I figured I\u0027d wait until the Go 1.16 code has all settled before working on reconciling them. I think this is the last CL blocking that.\n\n(I know there\u0027s CL 282716 too, but that\u0027s \"likely decline\" at the moment, and seems likely to be fully declined this week.)",
