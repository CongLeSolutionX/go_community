Its purpose is to register flags, and flag registration itself is generally not safe to perform concurrency.\n\nRather than a PR, please start by filing an issue describing the concrete problem you\u0027re running into.

It just looks to me that it is possible that the Init function may be called concurrently. If this is not true. Then there is no need to file an issue.",
