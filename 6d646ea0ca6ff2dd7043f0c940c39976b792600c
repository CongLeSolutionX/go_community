This means that people come expecting that we fully conform to the now listed RFCs. As we know, very few people ever read through the caveats of each RFC. Even worse is the fact that RFC 6532 just talks about extending the syntax from RFC 5322 (an already loose specification) as per https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6532#section-3.2, and doesn\u0027t exactly specify what divergences or enforcements it has.",
