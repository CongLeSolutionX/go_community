      "message": "Thanks for looking at my code. Sorry about the back-and-forth. It seems that your code worked fine; I just couldn\u0027t get my head around *why* it worked. I\u0027m happy to spend a bit of performance to make the code clear, not just for me but the next person who happens upon this code.\n\nI feel like this could still use more tests. I think the current tests are just TestFunVWW, TestNatDiv, and TestIssue37499. There\u0027s not a lot of test cases. Although it probably gets called from a lot of other tests that aren\u0027t explicitly tests for div itself.\n\nI ran coverage on this current CL (with the divWW intrinsic fix) and at least we\u0027re 100% covered on the new code. But I think we should try to stress divWW explicitly, maybe with random tests?\n",
