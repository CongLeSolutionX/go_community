Let me know what you think - do we need this release note at all, less or more detail, etc.?\n\nAlso, if we do want this note, I could see moving both of the implementation limitations down under the compiler section, rather than here in the language section.\n",

So the release note amounts to saying \"the compiler does not accept invalid programs\", which is definitely a good thing, but I don\u0027t know why it needs to be in the release notes.\n\nBut maybe I\u0027m missing something.",

They are generally valid (though not necessarily useful).  We could likely support them if we had some support for run-time instantiations and dictionaries in the implementation, but we don\u0027t, so we don\u0027t allow them.\n\nIt may still be the case that this isn\u0027t worth a release note, though.",
