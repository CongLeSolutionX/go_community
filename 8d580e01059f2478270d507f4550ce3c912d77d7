Let me know what you think - do we need this release note at all, less or more detail, etc.?\n\nAlso, if we do want this note, I could see moving both of the implementation limitations down under the compiler section, rather than here in the language section.\n",

      "message": "It\u0027s not obvious to me that we need a release note about this.  It seems to me that these programs are invalid.  So the release note amounts to saying \"the compiler does not accept invalid programs\", which is definitely a good thing, but I don\u0027t know why it needs to be in the release notes.\n\nBut maybe I\u0027m missing something.",
