      "message": "I think you are breaking the assembly policy by doing this. This assembly code is not implementing the corresponding Go code exactly. Essentially you are storing the expanded keys in a different order from what the Go code does, which is based on FIPs 197. As a result, if you use the assembler key expansion, then you can\u0027t use this expanded key in any other Go function. Likewise, the assembler versions of the encrypt and decrypt functions depend on the key expansion being done in the assembler function and won\u0027t work if it was generated by the Go function.",
