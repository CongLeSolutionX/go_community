      "message": "Hmm. My initial hunch was that tgkill was blacklisted on Android, but it looks like Bionic\u0027s raise is implemented using tgkill (from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/).\n\nIt doesn\u0027t seem like bionic does anything weird with SIGUSR1 either, based on grepping through that repo. In fact, it has a bunch of tests that use SIGUSR1.",
