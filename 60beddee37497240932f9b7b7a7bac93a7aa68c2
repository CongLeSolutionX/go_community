      "message": "this is unused until the \"add memory metrics\" CL, but it felt wrong to wait until then to include it, since then reading the sharded stats is unclear. I could break this CL up into \"shard stats\" and then later \"allow for reading sharded stats concurrently\"?\n\nalso, it could probably use a test. it\u0027s tested in CLs higher up which test the metrics implementation at a higher level, but it\u0027s not tested directly.",
