      "message": "Thanks.  The problem with this approach is that calling make with a very large but valid value will cause the program to fail to allocate memory and crash.  I think it would be fine to return an error if s.Size is negative when treated as a signed integer.  But if the value is in range, then we can\u0027t just return make; we still should go through saferio.ReadData or something similar, to keep us from crashing due to an out of memory error.",
