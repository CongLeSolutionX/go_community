I\u0027ve never been familiar with the code, it\u0027s intricate and delicate, and I\u0027m worried about Hyrum\u0027s Law--same reasons as I never mailed my fix to https://github.com/golang/go/issues/21755. I do idly wonder whether this change might also https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22371.\n\nAnyway, thanks for working on this Eva, and sorry I can\u0027t review it for you. Robert will get to it eventually, I\u0027m sure, but it may be a while as he\u0027s heads down on generics.\n",
