      "message": "It\u0027s messy. Some vector-scalar operate like an FPR instruction with access to an additional 32 registers. Some are restricted to vector registers due to encoding limitations. Architecturally, they are guaranteed to overlap the VS registers.\n\nIMO, it makes handwritten assembly easier to read when you don\u0027t need to switch argument types to avoid assembler limitations.\n\nMy hope is to minimize adding trivial extended mnemonics to the assembler which exist in many cases to give the appearance of using a VR or FPR in a VSX opcode.\n\nThe only downside might be typos of the form \"Vx\" or \"VSx\" when the other is intended.",
