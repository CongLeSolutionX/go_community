Maybe not *the* bug, but *a* bug.\n\nWe\u0027re not being careful about what the bounded bit means.\n\nOn OINDEX it means the bounds won\u0027t fail.\nBut also on pointers it means it is not nil.\nBut then what about\nvar a []*int \u003d ...\n*a[i]\nThe bit we use for boundedness of the indexing and non-nilness of the pointer are at the same place.\n\nI think we need to have a separate non-nil bit. Turns out we already have one! I think we just need to use it consistently.",
