      "message": "(subjective) I believe the readLoop/writeLoop approach is more readable.  But yes, it causes 2 goroutines to persist until Close. Since net.Pipe is mainly used for tests, maybe this isn\u0027t a big deal?\n\n@bcmills actually suggested something similar to what you\u0027re saying here. I never got around to trying his approach and profiling it. This will be a good experiment and we can apply the approach in other places if it proves worthy.",
