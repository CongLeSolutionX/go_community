      "message": "I see your point, but at the same time people working on the toolchain get crashes, and those crashes are far more useful if they print the full path, because then many tools and IDEs let you click on the file:line to go straight to that position in that source file. You lose that (unless you\u0027re in exactly the right directory) with relative paths. I spent years suffering from this problem in C debuggers, which is why I was careful to arrange for full paths in Go programs. Dealing with a compiler or go command crash is going to be far more common than accidentally writing a test that fails with -trimpath enabled. It seems like the wrong tradeoff to make development harder all the time just to catch a few bugs early.\n\nMaybe we should make the longtest builders set -trimpath always?",
