      "message": "finished implies done (as I tried to clarify in the comment).\n\n\"finished\" means the test function (func(t *testing.T)) passed to Run has completed. \"done\" means that all parallel subtests spawned by a test have completed. Parallel subtests are always run after the test body that spawns them returned.\n\nNote that in the current implementation under the hood all top-level tests are subtests (spawned by Run) by a single \"main\" test. So the semantics parallelism for subtests is exactly the same as for top-level tests.",
