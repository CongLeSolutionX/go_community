      "message": "This is too specific to the \"1.4 was the only previous release\" situation we had in Go 1.5. Now there are later releases that can be used, so this can be loosened a bit. Also, operating systems other than Sierra have problems. Suggest rewriting the remainder of this section:\n\n\u003cp\u003e\nThere are two options for obtaining an existing Go tool chain: use a binary distribution, or build one from Go 1.4 sources.
