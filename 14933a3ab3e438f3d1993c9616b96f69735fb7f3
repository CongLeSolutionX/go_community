On Unix variants (and probably on Plan 9), IO multiplexing is basically blocking/non-blocking synch. IO, so any IO handoff stuff is not required. On Windows, as far as I understand, we need to use async. IO, known as IOCP or RIO, for IO multiplexing, but we are not sure about the detail of such mechanisms.\n\nCan you please help us to understand what we should do for Windows?\n\nMr. Cox:\n\nYou ignored my mention to https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/internal/poll/fd_windows.go#L156 but I still think it could help to understand or suppose that how user-defined IO functions interact w/ the runtime-integrated network poller.",
