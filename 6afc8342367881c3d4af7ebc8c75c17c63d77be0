      "message": "\u003e did you verify that this doesn\u0027t allocate for the make?\n\nYes, see latest patch set. Turns out this is a second allocation and is much slower. \n\n\u003e How much do these typically grow to? 80 bytes or so?\n\nFrom some printf debugging they are generally less than 256bytes capacity. A few are in the 5-6 kb range, but not often.\n\n\u003e Why not just have a global of 100 zero bytes and turn the if into a for loop, and append up to 100 bytes until you\u0027re at the target cap?\n\nThis might work, we could also do what bytes.Buffer does and uses make + copy.",
