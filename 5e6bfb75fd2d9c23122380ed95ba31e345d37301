      "message": "nit: funcBody calls readFuncDcls with r.curfn set to fn. I don\u0027t think it matters, but I suggest we be consistent between the two to avoid surprises later if we change anything.\n\nI\u0027m also wondering if we need to worry about closures with empty bodies? I think it would be nice to just call funcBody here if possible without too much trouble. E.g., create a stub Inl so we can call funcBody, then move fn.Inl.{Dcl,Body} to fn.{Dcl,Body} and clear fn.Inl?",
