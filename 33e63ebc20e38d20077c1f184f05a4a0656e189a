      "message": "I cannot simplify new testDirLinks functions, because:\n- it tests relative path as well as absolute;\n- it not just checks that os.Stat returns correct value, but also verify that directory links leads to correct files.\n\nI can keep old version of TestStatJunctionLink (in addition to my new code), if you insist. But I think new code test everything that TestStatJunctionLink tests and more. So it just more code for us to look at in the future.",
