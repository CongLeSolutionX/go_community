      "message": "Probably an issue for another CL, but I wonder a bit about the lifecycle of a FuncDebug,\nand whether it would be profitable to zero out some of the slice contents (soon) after\ntheir values (as opposed to reusable storage) is no longer needed, or if it\u0027s mostly\npointless because they just point to other cached stuff.  Clearing might also accelerate\nGC slightly even if the referents are live, but I don\u0027t offhand know the ratio of GCs to\nfunctions compiled, or the ratio of clearing to tracing cost.\n\nI pinged Rick and Austin for a (rough) tracing/clearing ratio.",
