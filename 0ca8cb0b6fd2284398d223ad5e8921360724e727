      "message": "Hi Ian,\nThank you for the feedback!\n\n\u003e What kind of non-nil error might occur that would mean that MPTCP is available although this particular socket call failed?\n\nIndeed, a comment is missing here. I will fix that in a v2. I thought there was one but no, it was for another commit: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/471138/1\n\nIn short, MPTCP can be either be:\n* never available with the current kernel: `EINVAL` in \u003c5.6 or `EPROTONOSUPPORT` in \u003e\u003d 5.6 (because `CONFIG_MPTCP` has not been turned on when compiling the kernel) → a reboot is needed to have MPTCP\n* or \"temporarily\" not available: e.g. if the sysctl knob `net.mptcp.enabled` has been set to 0 → this situation can change during the current session\n * (Note: MPTCP could be blocked by the administrator using different techniques: SELinux, eBPF, etc. making the errno for such userspace blocks unpredictable)\n\nSo here, we only want to cover the case where MPTCP will never be available during the current session not to block MPTCP support if it is available later. In this case, the userspace program will first create an MPTCP socket and fallback to TCP if needed but that\u0027s OK.",
