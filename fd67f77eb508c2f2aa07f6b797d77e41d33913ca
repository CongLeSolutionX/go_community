I\u0027m pretty sure that this will already behave reasonably in the face of multiple concurrent SetCrashOutput calls.",

I think this is correct.\n\nI don\u0027t know if you want to go so far as to guarantee this, but I think this is even correct when you consider multiple producers and one consume (that is, multiple concurrent setCrashFDs and a single writeErrData). because panicking is always incremented before the load of crashFD, concurrent swaps with the load in any order always result in none of the involved FDs getting closed.",
