      "message": "There\u0027s some subtlety here, though I\u0027m fairly certain it\u0027s okay (and even if it\u0027s not, this is just an optimization). I was thinking this could fail to sysHugePage when it should if there was a combination of merging and realignment that caused there to be the same *number* of huge pages, but on different boundaries. But since realignment always grows s, I don\u0027t think this can actually happen.\n\nRegardless, this might be a bit more obviously correct if we instead tracked the actual range of huge page coverage before and after merging/realignment and looked for changes in that.",
