      "message": "I believe the previous approach was clearer. Instead of checking if IsBoolFlag returns true, wouldn\u0027t it make more sense to eliminate the return value entirely and simply check for the existence of the method? If a flag implements IsBoolFlag, it should inherently represent a boolean flag. The idea of implementing IsBoolFlag but returning false seems counterintuitive—why would something claim to be a boolean flag but then not behave like one? If it’s not a boolean flag, why implement IsBoolFlag in the first place?",

      "message": "Thank you for your prompt response. My point was actually about the boolFlag interface itself and its usages, which includes this case as well. I apologize for the time lag in bringing this up, but this MR seemed like the most relevant and recent place to address it. The original boolFlag merge request dates back around 12 years ago. :)Given that it was a resolved issue, I thought this would be an appropriate place to comment. However, if this discussion would be better suited to a new counter issue, please let me know, and I\u0027ll open one.",
