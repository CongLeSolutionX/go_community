      "message": "Added the previous tests back, they required only small modifications. \nI added the new tests while updating the logic to make sure that i am correct. They have much more test cases, than the previous tests. \n\n\u003e Is it possible to not change the tests?\n\nYes it is possible, but I don\u0027t know whether it is a good idea, the previous tests don\u0027t test every possible resolver type, updating them would probably introduce a lot more code, than writing them from scratch.",
