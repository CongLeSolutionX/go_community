      "message": "Probably neither..?\n\nIf we\u0027re looking for flags specifically, we should probably iterate over `cmd` until we find something beginning with `-`. But it\u0027s not clear to me why we want to omit the `-I \u003cincdir\u003e` flag in the first place, given that we do want to include the other flags added by compilerCmd.\n\nProbably the cleanest approach is to refactor (*Builder).compilerCmd into two methods: one returning the full command line, and the other returning only the path-insensitive additional flags.\n\n(That could help with #42628 too.)",
