      "message": "WaitGroup\u0027s are often local variables, and I don\u0027t see anything in particular that will cause them to escape.  Therefore they might be on the stack, and the stack might be copied.  Can we be confident that on a 32-bit system the alignment of a WaitGroup on the stack will remain the same?  If it changes, terrible things will happen.",

      "message": "Address of wg is passed to runtime_Semacquire/Semrelease in wg methods. This causes wg to always escape.\nAlso low 10 or so bits of addresses must be the same after stack copying. Changing low bits would indicate a bug in stack copying. Why any addresses can get an additional offset otherwise?..\n\nIf the rest looks good, I will add a comment and a test for stack copying.",
