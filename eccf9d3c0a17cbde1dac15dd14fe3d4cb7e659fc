By default, one of $HOME/go1.17,\n\u003e $HOME/sdk/go1.17, or $HOME/go1.4, whichever exists, in that order.\n\u003e We still check $HOME/go1.4 to allow for build scripts that still hard-code\n\u003e that name even though they put newer Go toolchains there.\n\nSo they shouldn\u0027t be removed or changed.\n\nThe default installer location should be found via the \"$(go env GOROOT) is tried for all \"go\" in $PATH.\" behavior. See lines 72 to 82 in make.bat. That is, if \"C:\\Program Files\\Go\\bin\" is in PATH, then it\u0027ll be found and used. If that\u0027s not the case, please file an issue for it.",
