      "message": "This is a question, I don\u0027t think changes are needed.\n\nI wanted to ask if there was a reason you opted to set cmd.Stderr explicitly, instead of extracting the error from https://pkg.go.dev/os/exec#ExitError.Stderr instead. Was it to guarantee the entire stderr would be printed, even if it\u0027s large? (If no specific reason, that\u0027s fine too, I think both approaches are viable.)",
