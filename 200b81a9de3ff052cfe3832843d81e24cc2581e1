      "message": "1) should not be an issue. That\u0027s just testing that the assembler works correctly. The assembler doesn\u0027t care what the float setting is (even if it is softfloat, the assembler will generate hardfloat instructions just fine).\n2) is not much of an issue. That\u0027s just for detecting a default goarm, which I think shouldn\u0027t matter. I guess if you were building on a v7-nohardfloat machine, it would autodetect to v5. But you can always override with explicitly setting GOARM\u003dv7,softfloat.\n3) This is which archs we run tests on. I would add \"v7,softfloat\" to that list and see what happens on a v7 machine. There might be a codegen test or two to fix up, but it should otherwise work.\n4) This has to do with build tags, and I don\u0027t think we\u0027re adding build tags for this option? (Just assembly macros, which don\u0027t count.)",
