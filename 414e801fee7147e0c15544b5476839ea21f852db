I thought it was because these were the two non-terminal states where we\u0027re waiting on the other side of the connection, but if I understand the comment on StateActive correctly, the other side of the connection could still wedge s.Close by sending 1 byte of a request and then not sending anything more. Why is it important to distinguish between the other side having sent 0 bytes and having sent 1 byte?",
