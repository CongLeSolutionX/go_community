I know none of the other fields have a comment, which is painful.  But the word \"Local\" is overloaded here: does it mean local to a package or does it mean local to a shared library?  That is, does it correspond to C static variable (can have multiple symbols with same name), or an STB_LOCAL symbol for which duplicates are not permitted, or a STB_GLOBAL/STV_HIDDEN symbol?",
