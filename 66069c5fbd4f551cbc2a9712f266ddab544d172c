      "message": "That\u0027s an option, but the complexity isn\u0027t completely eliminated. Either GetBody uses would need to be wrapped in something that resets a onceCloser / closed flag (or similar concept), or every usage of GetBody would need to have an additional flag-resetting line.\n\nTo me, it feels a little bit more risky to rely on resetting a flag wherever needed in the future if more places are added, but I could also see how it\u0027d be easier.\n\nWhat do you think?",
