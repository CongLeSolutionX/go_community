      "message": "As it turns out there are more bugs, this time in Delve itself, that were uncovered by the wakep CL. I\u0027m tempted to ask for a\n\n    lockOSThread(); defer unlockOSThread()\n\nto be added at the top of debugCallWrap. To be clear, that would be a workaround for bugs in Delve. I intend to rewrite Delve\u0027s side of call injection to take advantage of runtime.Pinner which would solve these bugs as well as others, but the lockOSThread would temporarily help, in case I don\u0027t get to do the rewrite in time for 1.22, and also with the guy that\u0027s implementing call injection for ppc64le.",
