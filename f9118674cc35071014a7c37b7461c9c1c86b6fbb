      "message": "I think it would be helpful to state was ISELB is currently used for: providing a boolean result based on a condition.\n\nAlso, since ISELB and the newly added ISELZ are similar, the ISELZ can now be generated in the later lowering pass for those cases where ISELB was before. If it has cases where it improves codegen, you could provide an example.",
