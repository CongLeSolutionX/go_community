Either this is not necessary or the tests are not sufficient.\n\nGenerally, this code seems also overly complicated. At this point we have identified all comments and all specs. It should be pretty straight-forward to assign comments to specs, by iterating through the specs (not the comments) and then associating the comments that are on the same line. For the comments on the same line, we just need to know if they are on the left or the right, which we can now by looking at their start position.",
