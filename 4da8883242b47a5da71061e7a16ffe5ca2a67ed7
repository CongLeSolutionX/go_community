      "message": "If at all possible, a test shouldn\u0027t call to base.Fatalf.  That will stop all other tests from running.\n\nWhy is the deferred os.RemoveAll not running?\n\nOr is the problem a different one, that the directory created elsewhere is not being removed?  If so I think we should use a TestMain function.  Look for TestMain in https://golang.org/pkg/testing.",

      "message": "Turns out that the base.Exit() call that I added was the cause of this problem.  In patchset 2, instead of calling base.Exit() I simply removed the call to Builder.Init, so it doesn\u0027t create a tempdir, and therefore has nothing to clean up.  We can create and cleanup our own temp dir in this function instead.\n\nAside: I\u0027m curious to know if there\u0027s a way to trace or debug \"go test\"?  I wasn\u0027t able to find a way to get strack traces in this (internal?) code.",
