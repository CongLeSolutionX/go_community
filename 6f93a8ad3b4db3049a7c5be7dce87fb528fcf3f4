      "message": "Of course. Actually should be \u003c\u003d.\nThe additional test did not cause any extra hits in std cmd, but it\u0027s still valid.\nTo my mind this changes the nature of the code somewhat so I\u0027ve renamed the MightBeNegativeOne condition to NeedsFixUp, because it\u0027s not just about a -1 divisor any more.\n\n3 days later and I\u0027m not so sure of this. I was originally under the impression that lim.umax was abs(lim.max) but now I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the case. Should this test really be abs(lim.max) \u003c\u003d MaxIntNN??\n\nI think the fog has lifted for me - the additional test should be dividend.limit.min \u003e MinIntNN.\nI\u0027ve implemented this and the number of hits increased from 94 to 11 in std cmd.\nJust sent another version of the CL.\n\nI will try to copy the list of hits below:\nsrc/crypto/rc4/rc4.go:42:29: Proved Mod64 does not need
