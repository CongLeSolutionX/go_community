      "message": "This one might actually matter. Once we combine stores, we have no rule that would fold constant offsets into it. Something like\n\n(STP [off] (ADDconst [off2] ptr) val1 val2 mem) \u003d\u003e (STP [off+off2] ptr val1 val2 mem)\n\nThere are also foldings for symbol offsets (setting aux to a symbol address), index generation (MOVDstoreidx), etc.\nI think we want to know if any of those are still foldable into these multi-store operations. If so, we want those rewrite rules. If not, we would need to decide whether the multi-store is better, or the address folding is better.\n\n\nJust as an example, consider:\n\nvar a []float64 \u003d ...\nvar x, y float64 \u003d ...\n\na[i] \u003d x\na[i+8] \u003d y\n\nDo we want to use two FMOVDstoreidx8 for this, or one ADDSHIFTLL $3 plus one STPD? Or is there a better option?\n\n(I think in this case the ADD+STPD is maybe better? But I\u0027m not sure, and there are lots of other examples along this vein that we should consider.)",
