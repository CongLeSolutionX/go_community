I hope this can be included in 1.19. Please let me know if there\u0027s anything else I can do to help move this forward. Thanks!",

      "message": "Sorry we missed this during the 1.19 cycle. Unfortunately I think at this point it probably needs to wait for 1.20 — test caching in `cmd/go` is already somewhat buggy (see, for example, #49267) and I\u0027d prefer to avoid the risk of exposing additional bugs (or further exposing that bug), especially at this point in the cycle.\n\nIdeally we should probably fix #49267 (and hopefully simplify the test-caching logic) before adding more test-caching complexity...",

Now that the tree has reopened for 1.20, I\u0027ll be sure to stay more active.\n\nThank you for all the thoughtful feedback in your review!\n\nI took a look at #49267 and left a comment to try to help move that issue forward as best I could.\n\nWhile I understand the reluctance to add complexity to a somewhat buggy system, I hope this change won\u0027t be blocked. The company I work for mandates test coverage data for all our software and it\u0027s painful to see how much compute is wasted in CI pipelines by running the same tests on unchanged packages.",

I generally agree that failures to write coverage profile data should fail the test run though.\n\nI\u0027ll wait for one of the \"go\" command experts to weigh in. If others agree with a change to fail tests here, I can dig a little deeper and file a new issue to correct the behavior. I think this can be changed independently of caching coverage profiles.",
