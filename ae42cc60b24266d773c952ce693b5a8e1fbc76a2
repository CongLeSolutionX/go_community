I hope this can be included in 1.19. Please let me know if there\u0027s anything else I can do to help move this forward. Thanks!",

      "message": "Sorry we missed this during the 1.19 cycle. Unfortunately I think at this point it probably needs to wait for 1.20 — test caching in `cmd/go` is already somewhat buggy (see, for example, #49267) and I\u0027d prefer to avoid the risk of exposing additional bugs (or further exposing that bug), especially at this point in the cycle.\n\nIdeally we should probably fix #49267 (and hopefully simplify the test-caching logic) before adding more test-caching complexity...",

I can say that this should be maintaining the previous behavior.\n\nThis was a great point to call out and I hadn\u0027t considered it before. However, I don\u0027t think I\u0027m in a good position to make the decision to change the behavior in this CL. I generally agree that failures to write coverage profile data should fail the test run though.\n\nI\u0027ll wait for one of the \"go\" command experts to weigh in. If others agree with a change to fail tests here, I can dig a little deeper and file a new issue to correct the behavior. I think this can be changed independently of caching coverage profiles.",
