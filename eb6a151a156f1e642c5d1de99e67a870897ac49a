      "message": "I\u0027m reluctant for the docs to say things like \"This is difficult to use correctly.\"  Condition variables are available in the standard library of a number of languages, so while they are more complicated than channels there is a lot of literature of how to use them correctly.\n\nI think it would be fine to say that for most use cases people should use channels.\n\nNormally when a condition variable is used every function that acquires the associated mutex does something with the condition variable.  So the comment about waiting goroutines, while true, seems a bit misplaced.",
