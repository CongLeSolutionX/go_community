      "message": "This may not be the best way to enable the functionality contained within this patch but I couldn\u0027t figure out another way of applying it to both raw assembly code and code generated by the compiler.  Happy to change if there\u0027s a better way.  Also, I\u0027d like to add a second option which allows the user to control the maximum number of prefix bytes that can be used.  Currently, I\u0027ve hardcoded this to 5, but I\u0027d like to make this configurable.  Once it\u0027s clear to me how best to add these sort of options, I\u0027ll update the patch.",
