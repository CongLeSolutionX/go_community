      "message": "Thanks for the CL!\n\nTo make it easier to review, could you break this to multiple separate CLs by components, like, one for assembler, one for compiler, one for linker, one for runtime, one for the rest?\n\nAlso, to make the review easier, maybe you could diff against the current wasm port? That is, in Patch Set N, upload a verbatim copy of the wasm source code but with new file path, and in Patch Set N+1 upload the real wasm32 source code, then we can diff PS N+1 against PS N to see what\u0027s changed.\n\nThanks!",
