      "message": "While the current example with rand.Int() likely won\u0027t be optimized away, it\u0027s a very peculiar property of the rand.Int() function itself and gives users a very false sense of security - invoking a function the same way in a loop, ignoring its return value.\n\nThe goal of the CL is two-fold: (1) partially address #27400 by adding documentation and (2) replacing the example with a less dangerous one (though I\u0027m not sure whether using Sink vs. runtime.KeepAlive is the right strategy and am open to other opinions)",
