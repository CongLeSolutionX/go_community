      "message": "I think the question here is what the user impact is. I forget, is there a visible change for users of debug/gosym? If so, maybe it should be mentioned in the minor changes section for that package. Or is the important thing for debug/gosym just that you might have to rebuild binaries that use debug/gosym if they\u0027re going to read binaries built with Go 1.20? We should probably be more explicit about that.\n\nI guess some users may be looking at the symbols in their Go binaries, e.g., from nm or a debugger. In that case, we could mention this here. I\u0027d put it at the bottom of the linker section, though.",
