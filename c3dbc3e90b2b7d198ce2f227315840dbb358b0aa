      "message": "I\u0027m wondering why this needs to traverse the whole chain, rather than just the `(*T)` on which `SetEnv` is called. The documentation for `Run` and `Parallel` doesn\u0027t really say what happens if the parent calls `Parallel` but the subtest does not.\n\n(Ideally we should both add a comment here, and update the package documentation in a separate CL to clarify.)\n\nFrom https://go.dev/play/p/69RoiFp3fhU, it appears that the subtests are run sequentially within each test, but concurrently with the subtests of other parallel tests?",
