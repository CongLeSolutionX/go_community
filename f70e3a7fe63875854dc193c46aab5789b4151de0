They will be merged in lexicographic order.\n\nWhat WOULD be helpful is if you did\n  go install golang.org/x/build/cmd/relnote@master\nand then ran\n  relnote generate path/to/your/local/go/repo\n  \n\nYou should get a document that matches yours. If it doesn\u0027t, you could edit the doc/next tree to make it match.",
