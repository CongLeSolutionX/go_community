      "message": "There is one subtlety here: currently, sysMap\u0027ing over an existing mapping is guaranteed to zero that range. That\u0027s true on Linux, too, and I think the other OSes. With this change, that\u0027s no longer true. However, I\u0027m pretty sure this is fine in the model we lay out for virtual memory management in malloc.go (\"OS memory management abstraction layer\"), since sysMap transitions memory out of \"Reserved\" and there\u0027s no way to put it back into \"Reserved\" (sysFault doesn\u0027t count).\n\nSo I\u0027m pretty sure this is okay, but would like to get Michael\u0027s thoughts on this before saying this is definitely okay.",
