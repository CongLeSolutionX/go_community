I would prefer it stayed as is.",

      "message": "Perhaps it is, but rewriting code to get around shortcomings in the compiler, although a long-standing tradition in the field, is not something I am comfortable with. Here you are duplicating some fairly subtle logic that really belongs in one place, where it can be maintained without worry about other places it needs to be fixed in case of changes down the road.\n\nPerformance improvement isn\u0027t always enough.",
