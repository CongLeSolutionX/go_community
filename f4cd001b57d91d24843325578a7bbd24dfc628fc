      "message": "I noticed issues with this test: besides the typo in the name, it relies on line numbering within this file, so changes here break the test (and I did by accident, initially, when preparing this CL).\n\nWhen I originally wrote the helper tests back in CL 38796, I specifically wrote helperfuncs_test.go to be the only file where the line numbering is golden, and noted that property with a comment at the top of that file.\n\nWhile fixing this it seemed nicer to add a new case to the existing test (TestTBHelper -- see helperSubCallingHelper in helperfuncs_test.go) rather than maintain a separate test. That saves around 20 lines of copy-pasted boilerplate.\n\nI can move all this to a separate CL if you prefer. It seemed like reasonably adjacent cleanup to just do here.",
