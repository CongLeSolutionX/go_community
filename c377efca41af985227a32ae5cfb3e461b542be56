So, I check using bisect to find commit that conflict with my patch. It\u0027s https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/271537 CL. But looks like it just add pool to splice.\n\nI continued to investigate the problem and find root cause: func (ord *randomOrder) reset(count uint32)\n\nIt fixes by adding explicit initialization of coprime array. It looks strange because other platforms didn\u0027t affected by this bug, except 32-bits platforms. And runtime/proc.go has the same method and it works well.\n\n\n",
