      "message": "Well, I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027m not the biggest fan of regex (and good thing too given Go\u0027s regex performance :-P). But I think my regex is correct. Unitless zero must occur at the end of the string to parse (otherwise, the value must be non-zero or unitfull[?]). It may have any number of zeros, and a final . is allowed only so long as it is preceded or followed by another zero. That should be the meaning of my regex. \n\nDo you have a reason for preferring your version of the regex? It\u0027s a bit hard for me to parse yours, and since it\u0027s just documentation, readability would seem to be paramount (for example, as written the regex didn\u0027t match the micro-symbol but the reader was expected to understand from context that micro is acceptable).",
