I don\u0027t think can ever be the case because checkTimers runs timers until it can\u0027t anymore (via rnow), and now is always updated with pollUntil from checkTimers.\n\nall this makes me think is that maybe checkTimers should document this invariant. it\u0027s a natural consequence of the implementation but it is relied upon by the user (findrunnable).",
