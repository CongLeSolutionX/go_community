It adds more steps but it\u0027s not complete, and making it complete doesn\u0027t help much as the high-level code is pretty well documented.\n\nThe existing comment is just here to give the big picture overview:\n\n- read arguments\n- parse source\n- typecheck source\n- compile code for functions\n- write out to disk\n\nLet\u0027s leave it as is.
