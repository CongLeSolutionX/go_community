So this test would still be correct.\n\nAs I understand it, the approved behavior for #29062 is to have tests panic if `os.Exit(0)` is called after tests have already started, but to still allow `TestMain` to invoke it explicitly before running tests (as is the case here).\n\n(That proposal is why there is no `testexit0` to parallel `mainexit0` in this script test.)",
