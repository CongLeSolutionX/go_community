I wanted to use the reproduction input from the issue, but also to have some parts to act as a documentation, like \u0027P\u0027, \u0027E\u0027, 0, 0...\n\nShould I actually create a valid go program with invalid pointer size and test on that?",

      "message": "The original post on #57002 claims that it was found through fuzzing, so probably the regression test should also be structured as a fuzz test (with the failing input either checked in to `testdata` or given in a call to `f.Add`).\n\nThen we could run the same test under the fuzzer to check for similar bugs.",
