      "message": "Looking again at libresolv, I agree that \"n \u003d 0\" here seems better.  (I\u0027m responsible for suggesting \"n \u003d 1\" initially; I forgot that atoi returns 0 for failure, not -1.)\n\nNote though that I don\u0027t think we care about exactly matching glibc behavior in bogus configurations.  E.g., \"ndots:-3\" is handled as identical to \"ndots:13\" by glibc.  I don\u0027t have much sympathy for users relying on this behavior.",

Don\u0027t like to think of users relying on that behavior either but unless we have a strong reason to deviate from glibc it\u0027s probably good to follow it.\n\nUpdated to use 0 if that\u0027s desired, PTAL.",
