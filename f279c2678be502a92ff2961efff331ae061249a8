      "message": "Hi Keith/Matthew:  what do you think about this change to make typecheckclosure() idempotent (not modify xtop).  I think this makes things clearer, will make my inline-functions-with-closures change less hacky, and should be better if we no longer do much typechecking in Noder.  I also tried to clarify current behavior with comment improvements.\n\nWe can also move the naming of the closure functions to findClosures() as well - that seems cleaner to me, but not sure if less desirable since it is moving closure functionality from closure.go to main.go\n",
