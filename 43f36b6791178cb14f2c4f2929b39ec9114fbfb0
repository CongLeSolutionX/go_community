Do you think combining them like so would be an improvement?\n\n    The File.WriteString method has been optimized to no longer make a copy of its input.\n\nTo make it more clear it\u0027s expected that there\u0027s no change to behavior? Though maybe it would become too much if we try to include it for each optimization. (The \"has been optimized\" phrase is something I found in https://golang.org/doc/go1.16.)",
