      "message": "This sounds worrying. Is that a reason the darwin/arm* builders have been experiencing weird crashes during bootstrap even before preemption? If so a better (although more involved) fix would be to re-write the TLS reservation code in Go. Do you agree? If so, I could work on that this week.",

But I\u0027m not sure what the signals are and where they come from. \n\nIt has been like this for a long time, and it only affects self-hosting bootstrap, which is not a common use case on iOS. So I guess we probably don\u0027t want to change TLS initialization and save/load G code late in this cycle.",
