      "message": "Oh, I didn\u0027t check that tzdata goes back before 1970. I just read that online. But that was just a cutoff point I picked somewhat arbitrarily. I was also considering the start of railway time, which was also in the 1800s.\n\nThe docs say \"if the offset corresponds to a time zone used by the current location (Local)\", so the question is what the definition of \"corresponds\" is. I\u0027d argue that in year 0, there weren\u0027t timezones yet, so +0000 mapping to Local because the user today is in London is kinda weird.",
