      "message": "If something was written before `Error`, then `WriteHeader` has already been called (explicitly or implicitly) and none of the headers have any impact. However, something could be written after `Error`. For example, there might be existing code like:\n\n```\nError(w, \"some error\", 400)\nfmt.Println(w, \"even more information\")\n```\n\nIf `Error` sets a content-length, then this becomes wrong.\n\nIn the common case, the error message will fit in the response buffer, and the http package will figure out and set the content-length automatically.",
