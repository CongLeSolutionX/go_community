The issue that you referenced has been closed, but also you haven\u0027t demonstrated a case in which there is a failure. Could you perhaps even describe what causes this infinite redirects and in deed, we need a test case. I am delighted to help you craft up the test, but you\u0027ll need to describe properly how you encountered and reproduced the reported issue. Thank you for the review, Brad!",
