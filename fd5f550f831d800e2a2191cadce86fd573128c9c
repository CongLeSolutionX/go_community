      "message": "Thanks. I left a minor comment inline, and I have a high level question below to better understand the motivation for this change.\n\nThis change improves these constants in a _test.go file, so the most it can do is change how image/jpeg tests and benchmarks operate, not the actual package itself. Clearly the tests must already be passing with the previous (less accurate) constants. So asking to understand better - what\u0027s the motivataion to improve the accuracy? Is it so that the signal from the test (which will presumably still pass) gives slightly better confidence? Or something else?",

      "message": "What\u0027s the motivation to make the change on this line? The math.Sqrt2 constant has enough precision to fill in a float64: https://go.dev/play/p/s6yhE3QvEKI. (If it didn\u0027t, it\u0027d create motivation to upstream the change to the math constant...)\n\nIs it so that it\u0027s possible to drop the \"math\" package import from this file? That doesn\u0027t seem like a good reason, since the \"math\" package is still present in the dependency graph, so there\u0027s not really an upside not to use it in one of the files.\n\nGiven math.Sqrt2 is shorter and more readable, it seems better to keep it as is. Unless I misunderstood something.",
