      "message": "That\u0027s what I tried first.\nBut in Go legacy profiles are not all that legacy, and I did not want to affect main usage mode (which is to pass a profile and a binary). I am not sure what will be the outcome if I pass both a profile with symbolization info and a binary. I suspect that we can have line info twice (as current symbolization will just append to slices), or maybe the inline symbolization info is not precise or bogus in some way (nobody tested it).\nFor background: I want to use this new mode from trace tool, it generates pprof profiles and I want to emit symbolization info into them. This is completely orthogonal to normal usage mode, and I don\u0027t want them to correlate.\nCan you suggest a way to strictly separate current behavior and this new mode?\nI also considered adding a new --symbolize flag mode. But I decided that not adding flags is better than adding flags.",

      "message": "If the trace tool is a new tool, independent of the runtime, I\u0027d recommend having it generate the profile in profile.proto. That way it can include symbol information and you will not need to make any changes to pprof.\n\nYou can use the code from pprof to encode the profile. I\u0027d be glad to help out as it is a step forward on the long term direction of switching all profiles to profile.proto.",
