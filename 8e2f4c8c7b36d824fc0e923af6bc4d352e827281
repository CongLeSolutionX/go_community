      "message": "This isn\u0027t testing the same thing that it did before. The test previously tested a single server and TimeoutHandler handling two requests, one which succeeds and one which times out. Now it tests two separate servers and handlers, and wouldn\u0027t detect the bug (https://golang.org/issue/9162) the test was created to exercise.\n\nI think I\u0027d test this by having NewTestTimeoutHandler take a Context rather than a timeout, and then provide a Context implementation that can be told to return a DeadlineExceeded on demand.",
