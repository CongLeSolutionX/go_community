      "message": "In general it\u0027s possible to use -linkmode\u003dexternal when cross-compiling.  It requires installing a cross-compiler and setting the CC environment variable to point to it.\n\nIn general you should not run \"ld\" directly here, because we never do that.  Note how hostlink in cmd/link/internal/ld/lib.go doesn\u0027t run \"ld\", it runs *flagExtLd, which defaults to gcc (in findLibPathCmd).   In normal use cmd/link is always invoked with the -extld option by cmd/go, which sets it to either $CC or $CXX (in gcToolchain.ld in cmd/go/internal/work/gc.go) or if they are not set then to a default that was determined when the Go toolchain was built.\n\nSo here you need to invoke the appropriate compiler, not \"ld\" directly.  Perhaps you can use \"extld -Wl,-V x.c\", with extld being passed in.",
