A possible concern is that if there are multiple ways to fix this problem, it\u0027s better to avoid making this seem like the only/best way. If this is a valid concern, then only describing the problem this vet check is catching would be a good a fix.\n\nI think it\u0027s okay to keep and revisit in future edit passes as part of work on #40700. Maybe other people will have thoughts on this.",
