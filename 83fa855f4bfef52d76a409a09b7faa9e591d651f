      "message": "We could also (rarely) end up with retracted modules in pkgMods here: if we are invoking findPackages due to an AmbiguousImportError, it is possible that one or more of the modules that provides the import is at a retracted version.\n\nThat information could turn out to be very important: if `go get` is going to terminate with an AmbiguousImportError involving both a retracted version and a non-retracted version, it seems important to tell the user which one is retracted so that they can resolve the ambiguity by removing that one instead of the other.",
