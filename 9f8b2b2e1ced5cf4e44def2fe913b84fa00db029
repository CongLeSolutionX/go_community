That\u0027s something that should be fixed; users shouldn\u0027t need to call RemoveAll manually.",

      "message": "FWIW, I opened this after reading https://mtlynch.io/notes/picoshare-perf/. The author says,\n\n\u003e From Googling, I discovered another gotcha with ParseMultipartForm.\n\u003e \n\u003e The documentation doesnâ€™t warn the reader, but the caller is responsible for calling r.MultipartForm.RemoveAll() to free the resources Go allocated during ParseMultipartForm. So, I was leaking memory every time I called ParseMultipartForm.\n\u003e \n\u003e To fix the leak, I rewrote my code to clean up the multipart resources. This fix looked promising, as I saw huge reductions in RAM usage on Fly after freeing resources explicitly.\n\nBut maybe he was using HTTP2?",
