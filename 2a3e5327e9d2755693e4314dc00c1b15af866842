      "message": "This mutex and timer manipulation is not appropriate in a benchmark — if a benchmark is not as simple as possible, it is likely to be too noisy or biased to be useful.\n\nIn general it is fine for a benchmark of a data structure (like `sync.Map`) to measure a mix of function calls, rather than just a single function call — real programs will execute a mix of function calls too, so that kind of benchmark will actually be more useful for measuring real-world performance.\n\nThat said: to avoid spurious allocations from the `Store` call, I would suggest using `i%256` instead of `i` so that the interface conversions for `Store` don\u0027t require extra allocations (see `runtime.staticuint64s`).",
