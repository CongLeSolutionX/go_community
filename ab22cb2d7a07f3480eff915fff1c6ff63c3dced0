If we add logical instructions here,\ndeciding which imm is bimm is not trivial, better to leave\nthat to liblink.\n\nalso, after remove the conditions at line 146, we can add\nlogical instructions now.\n\nWhen bimm is supported, we don\u0027t need to remember to\nmodify this file.",

      "message": "That is true, however, if we add logical instructions now, most of those instructions will load from memory (because of lack of bimm), so we replace an immediate move with a load from memory. I\u0027d expect that to significantly hurt performance.",
