      "message": "I am not sure if you considered this, but after calling timeBeginPeriod the way runtime.nanotime work changes. Values returned by runtime.nanotime are precise up to 15ms at the start. Then this changes to 1ms (after timeBeginPeriod call). Then calling timeEndPeriod changes this back to 15ms. And so on.\n\nI wonder if that will affect scheduler during \"idle\" time?",
