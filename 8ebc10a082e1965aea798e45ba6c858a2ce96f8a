      "message": "The .RF is fine in principle. I think the problem is that this inlined symbol names are unparseable in general (discussed in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/60324).\n\nSuppose I have this:\n\n\tfunc f1() {\n\t\tfor range x {\n\t\t\tsome code\n\t\t\tf2()\n\t\t\tfor range z {\n\t\t\t\tsome other code\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunc f2() {\n\t\tfor range y {\n\t\t\tsome other code still\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\nAnd everything gets inlined.\nWhat are going to be the symbol names for:\n\n* the call to x inlined into f1\n* the body of the first loop of f1 (containing \"some code\")\n* the call to f2 inlined into f1\n* the call to y inlined into f2 inlined into f1\n* the body of the loop of f2 inlined into f1 (containing \"some other code still\")\n* the call to z inlined into f1\n* the body of the second loop of f1 (containing \"some other code\")\n\nIf everything is inlined and delve is stepping through f1 and everything is inlined it needs to distinguish code that belonged to f1 from code that didn\u0027t. Maybe I\u0027m wrong but I\u0027m guessing that\u0027s not possible.\n\nAlso, as a user of Go, it seems to me that the autogenerated symbol names are getting out of hand but that gets us back to the (contentious) github issue above.",
