      "message": "To get this to work here, I had to add to the codesign invocation\n\n--entitlements Entitlements.plist\n\nwhere Entitlements.plist looks like:\n\n\u003c?xml version\u003d\"1.0\" encoding\u003d\"UTF-8\"?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003cplist version\u003d\"1.0\"\u003e\n\u003cdict\u003e\n    \u003ckey\u003eget-task-allow\u003c/key\u003e\n    \u003ctrue/\u003e\n\u003c/dict\u003e\n\u003c/plist\u003e\n\nBoy, it didn\u0027t take long for me to remember how deeply I detest iOS code signing.\n\nAnd with that, it works! Sadly, ios-deploy and/or lldb leaves my terminal in raw mode. :( I guess I\u0027ll have to file that one upstream. Meanwhile, I wrapped these commands in a bash script that also starts with \u0027save_state\u003d$(stty -g)\u0027 and ends with \u0027stty \"$save_state\"\u0027.\n\nI think it\u0027d be nice to include an entire well-structured working app, including helloworld.go and Entitlements.plist. These instructions could instead be a nicely commented bash script. Then the instructions would just be to run the bash script and edit as desired.",

      "message": "Sorry for not reading this CL earlier (I\u0027m putting it off until rsc is back). I actually have that shell script and this silly Entitlements.plist as part of an almost-ready darwin-arm builder.\n\nI think what\u0027s here is fine for the README. Ultimately I would like to package up this logic for people to use in a tool. The email break over christmas got me github.com/crawshaw/apk, which builds an apk. My original plan was to roll it into the go tool, so when you go build with GOOS\u003dandroid, you get an apk.\n\nBut none of that makes sense for ios, and I\u0027d like similar build stories. So right now I\u0027m wondering about golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile, to both build .apks and iOS apps.",
