      "message": "To get this to work here, I had to add to the codesign invocation\n\n--entitlements Entitlements.plist\n\nwhere Entitlements.plist looks like:\n\n\u003c?xml version\u003d\"1.0\" encoding\u003d\"UTF-8\"?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\"\u003e\n\u003cplist version\u003d\"1.0\"\u003e\n\u003cdict\u003e\n    \u003ckey\u003eget-task-allow\u003c/key\u003e\n    \u003ctrue/\u003e\n\u003c/dict\u003e\n\u003c/plist\u003e\n\nBoy, it didn\u0027t take long for me to remember how deeply I detest iOS code signing.\n\nAnd with that, it works! Sadly, ios-deploy and/or lldb leaves my terminal in raw mode. :( I guess I\u0027ll have to file that one upstream. Meanwhile, I wrapped these commands in a bash script that also starts with \u0027save_state\u003d$(stty -g)\u0027 and ends with \u0027stty \"$save_state\"\u0027.\n\nI think it\u0027d be nice to include an entire well-structured working app, including helloworld.go and Entitlements.plist. These instructions could instead be a nicely commented bash script. Then the instructions would just be to run the bash script and edit as desired.",
