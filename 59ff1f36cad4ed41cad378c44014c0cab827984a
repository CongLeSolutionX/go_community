      "message": "I think this is even more confusing. To me it implies that the default value of the `-count` field may be arbitrarily different from 1 if the test is cached, but that isn\u0027t true â€” specifying any value at all on the command line causes the test not to be cached, so the default behavior can only run the test 0 or 1 times.\n\nEspecially given that the caching behavior is already covered in the paragraph at line 121, I don\u0027t think this is a net improvement.",
