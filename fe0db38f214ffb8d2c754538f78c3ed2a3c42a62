      "message": "Why is this sentence \"Note that\" but the next two sentences aren\u0027t?\n\nAlso, this sentence is a bit confusing, suggesting (with one possible reading) that the caller must call CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey on key before calling this function.\n\nI\u0027d say \"canonicalized\" instead of \"canonically encoded\".\n\nMaybe:\n\n   // Get gets the first value associated with the given key.\n   // It is case insensitive; textproto.CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey is used\n   // to canonicalize the provided key.\n   // If there are no values associated with the key, Get returns \"\".\n   // To access multiple values of a key, or to use non-canonical keys,\n   // access the map directly.",
