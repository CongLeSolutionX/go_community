      "message": "Opcode is encoded into Offset according to the nstruction \"ld1 (Rn), C_List\", ld2-ld4 instructions have different opcode value from ld1. I have two suggestions: one is encoding opcode in asm7.go not in parsing time, another one is considering the register number and opcode of ld2-ld4 is constant, we can reuse checkoffset() to check register number. Maybe last one is easy to do. \nAnd I think it is unreasonable to use o.param to check register number.\nIf we reuse checkoffset(), we can also reuse case 81.",
