So I don\u0027t see why this change is required.\n\nTo put it another way: this change should have a test that fails before this change and passes after this change.\n\nThanks.",

      "message": "I will attempt to create a test that shows how this can happen, but the problem is relatively timing dependent. The situation is relatively straightforward: If I (as user code) attempt to issue a WSAIoctl on something that is already being polled by the runtime (ie, a connection that I got through \n\n```Go\n\tconn, err :\u003d net.Dial(\"tcp4\", fmt.Sprintf(\"%s:%d\", *serverIp, *serverPort))\n```\n\n) then I hit this situation straight on the head. The code that I am using to reproduce is at \n\nhttps://github.com/hawkinsw/windowpane\n\nI will include a trace of the panic output on the bug report. \n\nI hope that is okay? Thanks for the quick feedback!",
