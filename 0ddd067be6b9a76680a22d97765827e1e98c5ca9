At least tooldir and VERSION.cache still exist and won\u0027t get caught by the header check. pkg/obj is created during bootstrapping, and while an uninterrupted bootstrap should delete that on its own, I can see the logic that clean should also delete it.\n\nIf this is safe to drop, perhaps explain why in the commit message.",
