      "message": "It looks like this will always run the benchmark -benchsplit times.  If a single iteration of the benchmark is slow, that could push total benchmark time well beyond -benchtime.  I think this loop needs to terminate early if we reach -benchtime.",

      "message": "Heh, I was arguing in the opposite direction: that splits are not particularly useful if they\u0027re too short, so we should ensure that each split runs for at least benchtime√∑benchsplit.\n\nI wonder whether it would be simpler to express the split as a multiplier rather than a divider, though: that seems less ambiguous, as there would be no question as to whether intervals should be divided (and rounded either up or down) or summed (and potentially distributed very unevenly).",
