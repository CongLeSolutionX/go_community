      "message": "Heh, I was arguing in the opposite direction: that splits are not particularly useful if they\u0027re too short, so we should ensure that each split runs for at least benchtime÷benchsplit.\n\nI wonder whether it would be simpler to express the split as a multiplier rather than a divider, though: that seems less ambiguous, as there would be no question as to whether intervals should be divided (and rounded either up or down) or summed (and potentially distributed very unevenly).",
