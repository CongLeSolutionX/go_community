      "message": "Is it perhaps easier to describe the behaviour as being equivalent to @upgrade?\n\nThat would require a rejig in the order of the docs, but I think it would be much clearer as a result.\n\nBecause as things stand, an earlier sentence still reads \"By default, get chooses the latest tagged release version\"... and this caveat only appears a couple of sentences later. Being able to say something like, \"when no version is specified, get behaves as if @upgrade had been supplied\"?",

      "message": "I expect @upgrade will almost never be used explicitly; it\u0027s more important to describe the default behavior. I\u0027d also rather not introduce the @ suffixes until we\u0027ve covered the default behavior.\n\nI\u0027ve changed this a little bit to say \"looks up\" instead of chooses. That makes it sound a little more tentative -- we don\u0027t say which version will be used until the last sentence.\n\nI realize these docs leave a lot to be desired. At some point in the 1.14 cycle, I hope we can move much of this out of the go command, into golang.org/doc. We\u0027d have more room for examples, and it would be easier to link to a section in what is now \u0027go help modules\u0027 that describes all the version queries in one place.",
