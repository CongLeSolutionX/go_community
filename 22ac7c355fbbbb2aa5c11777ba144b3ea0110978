      "message": "When the branch is highly unpredictable, it is definitely better to avoid the speculative load. This was one of the key optimizations in https://github.com/golang/go/commit/77a9cb9b4c8f13e7b08ae855699146cbddbdd752. I no longer remember any numbers, but I recall being surprised by how big the impact was, at least in this case. It was high enough that I went and poked around the runtime to see if there was anywhere I could apply the same branch avoidance. :)\n\nI\u0027m still OK with this change going in; I trust that if it causes major regressions, we\u0027ll hear about it, and we can figure it out from there.",
