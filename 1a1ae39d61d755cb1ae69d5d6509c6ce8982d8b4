      "message": "Technically I think we already had problems with that log specifically -- any log line starting with an update string would be parsed as that update, even if it was just a random log. But, we are introducing a new set of problems for tests that log the update string in the middle of a message (i.e. t.Log(\"some info \u003d\u003d\u003d Run\")).\n\nI think this is a worthy tradeoff -- I can\u0027t think of a good use case where you\u0027d need a log with one of these magic strings, but I can think of lots of situations where logging happens async/contains newlines/otherwise garbles the output format, breaking the current update parsing.",
