      "message": "Technically I think we already had problems with that log specifically -- any log line starting with an update string would be parsed as that update, even if it was just a random log. But, we are introducing a new set of problems for tests that log the update string in the middle of a message (i.e. t.Log(\"some info \u003d\u003d\u003d Run\")).\n\nI think this is a worthy tradeoff -- I can\u0027t think of a good use case where you\u0027d need a log with one of these magic strings, but I can think of lots of situations where logging happens async/contains newlines/otherwise garbles the output format, breaking the current update parsing.",

      "message": "from github:\n\n    We have two unlikely scenarios; which is less likely?\n\nI would argue that consumers intentionally logging a magic string is much, much less likely (and much more easily fixed) than loggers outputting trailing newlines or logging things concurrently with the test logger. Based on the linked github issue, several similar issues (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/38063, https://github.com/golang/go/issues/33419), and conversations with the gotestsum maintainers (https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/issues/141, https://github.com/gotestyourself/gotestsum/pull/253), I felt confident that folks were fairly aligned on this being a clear solution to this problem. Is there anything I can do to lend further confidence here?\n\n    We are currently in a release freeze for the 1.19 release.\n\nSounds good. When should I check back for a review? ",
