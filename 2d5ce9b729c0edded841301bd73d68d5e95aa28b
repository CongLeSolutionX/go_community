      "message": "Thanks for the CL. Sorry for the late comment (was OOO last week).\n\nOn darwin, pthread_get_stacksize_np gets the actual stack size whereas pthread_attr_getstacksize gets a \"default\" stack size, which may not match the actual one. This CL seems to undo that. See also CL 415915.\n\nAlso, runtime/cgo/gcc_stack_*.c handles getting the stack bounds in a way that is more specific to the OSes. Maybe we could use that code instead?\n\nThanks.",
