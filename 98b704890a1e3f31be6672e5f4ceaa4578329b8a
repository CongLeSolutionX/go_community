Is it used just to add/remove type names?  Does it allow sign/unsign conversion?  Does it allow changing width (wider or thinner)?  I think we need to write down what ssa expects of such conversions and check them here.\n\nI think we expect the width not to change.  Maybe signedness might change, and I think the backend is (recently) ok with that.",
