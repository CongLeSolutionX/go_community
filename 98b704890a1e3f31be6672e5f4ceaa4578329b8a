Is it used just to add/remove type names?  Does it allow sign/unsign conversion?  Does it allow changing width (wider or thinner)?  I think we need to write down what ssa expects of such conversions and check them here.\n\nI think we expect the width not to change.  Maybe signedness might change, and I think the backend is (recently) ok with that.",

I suppose I could modify x\u0027s Type in place, but that seemed awkward. Would you prefer that?\n\n\n\u003e So what exactly does CONVNOP mean anyway?\n\nAs I understand it, it means \"the in-memory representation of these two Nodes is identical\". As such, it does not allow changing width or sign, although it does allow changing (say) etype.\n\nI\u0027ve added a bunch of checks that exhaustively cover all the CONVNOPs that the front end currently generate.\n\nEverything is ok (I think) except closures, which are not yet handled.
