      "message": "mini-nit: I don\u0027t see any bugs, but it seems odd to me that this queue is only used for the one extra event case. IMO, the more intuitive cases would be:\n\n* `advance` does not return anything except an error. It puts all new events on the queue, and callers should drain the queue before calling advance again.\n* Alternatively, the queue is completely hidden inside `advance`. The first thing `advance` does it return something from the queue if non-empty.",
