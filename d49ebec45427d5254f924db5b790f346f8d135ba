      "message": "Avoid lines like this. If you have to pass a closure to a function call in a non-final position, hoist it out and give it a name, so that the function call is not interrupted by a giant function body. In this case, that means giving the function above this line its own name.\n\nThat said, this approach to the test is kind of complicated anyway. Better would be to revert all the new complex mechanism here and then just define that in the need []string list, \"x;y\u003dz\" means function x with label y\u003dz, and then check that during the search in the original code.",
