      "message": "I would argue that people should not be using runtime.Version for that. That is, use runtime.Version as a replacement for these missing build tags can be confusing for the user, and also prone to subtle bugs.\n\nWhat about saying \"if there is a need to know the specific Go version being used.\"?",

      "message": "I would like the sentence to clarify that runtime.Version() includes the minor version too, hence I used \"at that granularity\". \"specific Go version\" is not super clear on that.\n\nIf it is confusing, maybe we should remove the second sentence altogether. But I just put it there since Ian suggested it in the issue.\n\nIan, what do you think ?",
