      "message": "I managed to not notice before that this system implies that each package can be in at most one shared library.  If we put it in another shared library we will lose the information.  Is that OK?  It suggests that we should give an error if the package is already in some other shared library, perhaps when creating the .shlibname file.",

      "message": "You\u0027re right.  I\u0027m not sure there is a sensible way we can record that a package is in multiple shared libaries, or more accurately, I\u0027m not sure there\u0027s anything useful we can do with that information if we do record it.  We probably should give an error, but there needs to be some care to not fail halfway through the installShlibname steps I think.  And definitely not in this CL :-)",
