My theory was (is?) that when this was first written, prefix was a path and this removed a trailing slash, but it\u0027s only a guess.\n\nBut now prefix is guaranteed to always ends with a valid semver (i.e. at least a digit preceded by \"v\"), because mod.Version is validated in DownloadDir before this function is called (L45).",
