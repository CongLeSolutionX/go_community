      "message": "How about replacing the single remaining use of _g_, below, with getg(), and removing _g_ entirely?\n\nFor that matter I think it would be fine to replace the use of _g_ with gp.  This function basically assumes that if _g_.m.lockedg !\u003d 0, then _g_.m.lockedg \u003d\u003d gp.  Which as far as I can see will always be the case.  If it were somehow not the case, if _g_.m.lockedg could be nil but _g_.m.lockedg !\u003d gp, then calling execute(gp, false) would not be correct.\n\nSo perhaps _g_ should be replaced with gp below, with an appropriate comment.",
