      "message": "This is getting pretty silly. Did this CL actually affect the output somehow, or are you just running a different GDB version on your workstation?\n\nIMO, it would be sufficient to check that the output contains all three variable names. (I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any good reason that the first RE leaves out mapvar, it\u0027s just historical.) If we want to test that the values are correct we should be doing that with an explicit print to avoid exactly the ordering issues you\u0027re seeing here.",
