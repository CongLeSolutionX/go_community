      "message": "The phrases “For historical reasons” and “the real value” are not appropriate in this comment, because they don\u0027t convey any additional meaning. Whether you want to report CPU time or wall time depends on what you\u0027re trying to measure with the benchmark: if you are trying to fix a concurrency bottleneck, for example, wall time may be more useful than CPU time. (And a proper reckoning of “CPU time” would take parked goroutines into account too: there are at least three different notions of “time per op” that could be meaningful here.)\n\nInstead, document what the actual semantics are. Perhaps:\n\n```\n// RunParallel reports ns/op values as wall time for the benchmark as a whole,\n// not the sum of wall time or CPU time over each parallel goroutine.\n```",
