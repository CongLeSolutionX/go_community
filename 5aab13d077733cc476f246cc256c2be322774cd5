      "message": "I still can\u0027t grok what all the numbers might be for. It needs an example, at least.  How about something like:\n\n    A\n  / | \\\n B C  D\n\nA entry: 2 exit: 23\nB entry: 5 exit: 9\nC entry: 11 exit: 15\nD entry: 17 exit: 21\n\nSo 2 is at A\u0027s entry, 3 is between A\u0027s phis and body, 4 is after A but before its children, 5 is at B\u0027s entry, etc.  Explain 21, 22, 23 also.  And check my math.\n\nI\u0027m also confused by all the off-by-one tidbits in here.  We tell b to start numbering at n, but then its entry field is n+1.  Huh?  Can\u0027t numberBlock(b,n) start numbering b at n and return the next free number after it is done?",
