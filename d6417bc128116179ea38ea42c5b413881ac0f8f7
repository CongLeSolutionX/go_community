      "message": "If 2 invocations of growStack (one with i\u003d\u003d1, and one with i\u003d\u003d0) are causing the stack to grow, then it must be right past the edge where we trigger a stack growth. The stack frame of growStack is tiny. That makes this test pretty fragile, as any change in the stack frame size of any ancestor might prevent it from growing the stack, or causing some frame higher in the stack to grow the stack instead.",
