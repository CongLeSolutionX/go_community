      "message": "Hi Steven! Thanks for reporting this issue and working on the patch. I wanted to avoid a new allocation at all costs, so I was looking into alternative options to fix this. I ended up going a completely different direction (I also needed to make a few fixes to the current test code as well), so I made a new patch here and credited you: https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/348610\n\nThanks again!",
