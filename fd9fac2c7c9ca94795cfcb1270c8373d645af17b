      "message": "It is nice to see a few of these errors, though I\u0027ve honestly never found much value in more than one from the linker.\n\nMy concern here was that, besides this package not having easy access to Errorf, that fallthrough seemed quite wrong. It sets up rp with a Type and Add value that are almost certainly wrong. So the extra errors you may see after this may be generated by the fallthrough itself. I think it\u0027s better to have fewer errors than a potentially misleading error.",
