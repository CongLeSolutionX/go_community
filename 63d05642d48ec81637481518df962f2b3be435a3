      "message": "Hello Bryan,\n\nI am not sure if it is important or not. But\n\nDan set auto-submit +1 flag on patch set 4 (10:46AM my time). Then David +2 this CL at 11:10. I expected David +2 together with your +1 should have triggered auto-submit into action. But nothing happened. So I pushed Submit button manually at 11:17.\n\nAm I confused about auto-submit button?\n\nThank you.\n\nAlex",

      "message": "If I am reading the logs correctly, it looks like gopherbot fetched the state of the world at 01:10 UTC (likely just before the +2), worked on that for ~60s, then took 8.5min to fetch the state of the world again, which completed at 01:20 UTC, after you\u0027d already clicked submit.\n\nI\u0027m not sure why the fetch was so slow, but I think it would have worked given enough time.",
