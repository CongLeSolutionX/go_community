      "message": "Thanks.\n\nIt looks like the term CamelCase is better known than PascalCase (there\u0027s a wikipedia entry for the former; I didn\u0027t see one for the latter).\n\nThere\u0027s a reason CamelCase is spelled exactly as is in this doc - to make it apparent that we talk about upper camel case rather than lower camel case.\n\nSo I don\u0027t see a reason for changing this, personally. It seems pretty clear.",
