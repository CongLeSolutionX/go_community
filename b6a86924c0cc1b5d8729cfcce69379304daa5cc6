      "message": "I think this is a fine start. We can always iterate, possibly even during the freeze as documentation won\u0027t affect the code.\n\nWe discussed this in the compiler/runtime mtg and concluded an URL and the flag -url is ok. The benefit of this is for novice users. Nobody mentioned the need for a proposal.\n\nThat said, if we have a proposal (which is fine by me), it probably needs to specify the form of the URL so that tools can do something with it if they like. I would suggest that any URL is fine as long as its last component is one of the error code names - that\u0027s really all we need.\n\nStill, I think it\u0027s ok to submit, exactly so we can experiment and try it out. It\u0027s trivially disabled after all (remove the flag).",
