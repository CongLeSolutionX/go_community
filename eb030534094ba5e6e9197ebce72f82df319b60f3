Why not 80 or 128?\n\nIt should be large enough that let\u0027s say 95% of the cookies\nneed no extra allocation.\n\nThis value 100 should be large enough so that a \"typical\" set\nof cookie-avs will fit in (plus the \"\u003d\" in name\u003dvalue, the\n\";\" separators, optional spaces, etc.)\n\nThe length of\n\n    \"\u003d; Path\u003d/; Max-Age\u003d60000; Expires\u003dTue, 12 Mar 2019 08:49:37 MST; Domain\u003d.en.wikipedia.org; HttpOnly; Secure\"\n\nis 107. Which is a bit longer than the 100. Using just Max-Age\nor just Expires brings it below 100. But here the Path is the\nshortest possible one. It\u0027s complicated...\n\nI think that an unset Path or Path\u003d/ are the most common\nvalues followed by short Paths. Domains are \"short\" (if set\nat all). These assumptions give a \"typical max length\" for the \nadditional stuff of ~130 characters. But this number is just\na gut feeling.\n\nI would suggest to increase this number to 140 and to justify this\nvalue in the commit message. Something along:\n140 extra characters allows to write all extra cookie attributes\nwith nontrivial values.",
