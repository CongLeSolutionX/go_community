      "message": "Wayne, thanks for taking a look at this!  But as I note below, your fix is not correct.  I have been working on the fix through another bug (the last case given in issue #47514).  See my change https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/345411.\n\nDo you want to keep this CL, remove the fix, but keep the tests, and check in the new tests you\u0027ve added after I check in my CL above?  I\u0027ve verified that my CL fixes all your new tests (i.e. the cases in issue #47892).",
