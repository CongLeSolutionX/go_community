      "message": "This will add a string (at best one byte, at worst the length of the string + 1 byte or so) to each sym, whether needed or not. This surely will blow up export data and possibly impact import and thus compile speed.\n\nAlso, this is clearly a format change making all other export datas incompatible and basically requiring all packages to be re-built.\n\nThis needs to be done more carefully:\n1) We should only write this information when needed (if we can tell from the context we don\u0027t need special bits in most cases)\n2) Either way, this needs a format version change so we are compatible with old files\n3) We need tests, incl. measurements showing impact (or no impact) on compilation performance and export data size.",
