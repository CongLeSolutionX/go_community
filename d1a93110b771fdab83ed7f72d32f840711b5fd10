In particular, I don\u0027t understand the difference between an app id and a team id. There\u0027s no documentation on this at all, and I only got this working by examining the decoded .mobileprovision files, guessing, and trial and error.\n\nI\u0027m sorry. Feel free to leave this, and I\u0027ll try again in a few days when I\u0027m less frustrated.",
