Why would `go list` not report importing main error, whereas `go list -test` does? Is it an intentional choice?\n\nInteresting. That error message comes from here:\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/master:src/cmd/go/internal/load/pkg.go;l\u003d784;drc\u003d34d6aaae29023b9edfef2d3360d89e48c8dd118f\n\nI don\u0027t know why `go list` would fail to report the error prior to this CL â€” that certainly seems like a bug. ðŸ˜… (That test should probably be using the `-e` flag, like `go list -f {{.Dir}} -tags tools -e all`.)\n\n\u003e For get_dash_t, it shows many error for failing to load package, like\n\n\u003e           golang.org/x/build/autocertcache/autocertcache.go:13:2: cannot find \u003epackage \"cloud.google.com/go/storage\" in any of:\n\u003e I guess go get -t doesn\u0027t download tests for transitive dependencies whereas go list -test ... tries to list them?\n\nThat test is _definitely_ problematic. `go list ...` lists all packages in the known universe (for that particular test, all packages found in `GOPATH`). The dependencies of those packages may well be unresolved, because the `go get` command in that test will pull the entire `x/build` repo into `GOPATH`. It should instead use `go list -test github.com/rsc/go-get-issue-8181/b`.\n\n----\n\nI think the thing that concerns me most about those failures is that I don\u0027t understand why they weren\u0027t _already_ failing. ðŸ˜©",
