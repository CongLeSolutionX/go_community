      "message": "Thanks for the review, Rob.\n\nMatthew, can you take a look?  Based on our discussion this morning, I see that the packages created in readImportFile() are already using the resolved path in resolveImportPath() that includes the vendoring remapping.  So, I think I should just remove lines 188-191 in fmt.go.  I.e there\u0027s really nothing else we need to do to make sure package paths are unique, even in the presence of vendoring.\n",
