# Treat all files in the Go repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. This produces predictable results in different environments.
#
# Windows users contributing to Go will need to use a modern version
# of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# Windows .bat files are known to have multiple bugs when run with LF
# endings, and so they are checked in with CRLF endings, with a test
# in test/winbatch.go to catch problems. (See golang.org/issue/37791.)
#
# We'll prevent accidental CRLF line endings from entering the repo
# via the git-codereview gofmt checks and tests.
#
# See golang.org/issue/9281.

# Do not try to display diffs for zipdata.go.
# It is a Go string encoding of a binary zipfile, and not meant for human consumption.
# To review changes to that file, regenerate it independently and check for diffs.
