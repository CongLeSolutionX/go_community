      "message": "To be honest I don\u0027t know what this means.  I think I can figure it out from the CL description.  But right now I think this sentence just increases confusion.  If we think it\u0027s important to explain the exact type returned for a network, I think we should list them: \"tcp\" returns TCPConn, etc.  But I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth doing.  The whole point of Dial is so that people don\u0027t have to think about it.  What if we reverse it: document, for TCPConn, and Dial with \"tcp\" will return that?",
