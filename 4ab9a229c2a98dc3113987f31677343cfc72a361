      "message": "In general the Go tree uses the American quotation convention for quoted English text (as opposed to Go quoted strings), in which terminating punctuation is placed inside the quotation marks, so the current text is correct. (You may be familiar with the British convention, in which the punctuation is after the closing quotation mark.)\n\nThere is also in general no need to worry about sending corrections if some British-convention quotation marks have crept in. We are not exceedingly worried about that specific detail in the commentary.",
