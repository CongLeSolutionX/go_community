There\u0027s some javascript goo for hiding and showing the help text that you could probably adapt for the purpose.\n\nOr maybe even better, a \"show dominators\" link up at the top (near the help link) that hides/shows all dominators for the entire function, thus keeping each pass header simple and clean?",
