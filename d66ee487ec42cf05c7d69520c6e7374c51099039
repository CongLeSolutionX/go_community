      "message": "At the risk of bikeshedding this a bit, I\u0027d like to propose a slight rewrite. My reservations about the current text:\n- \"the pointer target\" sounds like the target of a pointer.\n- \"value of err\" implies err itself, not the error inside the chain.\n- the requirement of the As method implementors is disconnected from when it is first mentioned.\n- the proviso about panicking, and the nil behavior, is more of a footnote.\n\nWhat do you each think of this revised wording?\n\n\u003e As finds the first error in err\u0027s chain that matches target, and if so, sets target to that error value and returns true.\n\u003e \n\u003e An error matches target if the error\u0027s concrete value is assignable to the value pointed to by target, or if the error has a method As(interface{}) bool such that As(target) returns true. In the latter case, the As method is responsible for setting target.\n\u003e \n\u003e As will panic if target is not a non-nil pointer to a type that implements error, or if it is not of interface type. As returns false if err is nil.",
