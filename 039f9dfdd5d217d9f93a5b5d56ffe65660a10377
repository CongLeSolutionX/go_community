How do you know that ReadFile will always provide you only with \"full multi byte characters\"? If  you will get half of character, you next ReadFile will start with second half of that character. Do you think MultiByteToWideChar will be able to handle these?\n\nI do not think we should assume any of that. In fact I will add new test for that (see https://go-review.googlesource.com/33030).",

So we need to read whole of buffer. As I wrote in comment of this change, ReadFile have problem to read with small buffer. So I changed this to read with enough buffer.\n\nI\u0027ll try to separate changes, however seems to be difficult.",
