# Trace golden tests

Trace tests can be generated by running

```
go generate .
```

with the relevant toolchain in this directory.

This will put the tests into a `tests` directory where the trace reader
tests will find them.

A subset of tests can be regenerated by specifying a regexp pattern for
the names of tests to generate in the `GOTRACETEST` environment
variable.
Test names are defined as the name of the `.go` file that generates the
trace, but with the `.go` extension removed.
