	// pointers.
	//
	// The dartboard density directly correlates with the efficiency of both
	// flushing to the dartboard and of dense scans.
	//
	// Almost all work buffer memory overhead is from the bottom layer, and the
	// size of that is directly proportional to the density we want to achieve
	// (and the heap size), so we can build a network that dials in a specific
	// overhead by setting the desired density.
	//
	// The amount of memory in work buffers in turn directly correlates with how
	// much work can be held in buffers (requiring sparse scans) before making
	// it to the dartboard (for dense scans).
	//
	// Thus, lower values of this (higher density) increase the efficiency of
	// flushes and dense scans, but increase the amount of work held in work
	// buffers.

	// buffers at the bottom level. Thus, lower values of this reduce the

	// contention.

	//
	// Higher values of this reduce the height of the network, but increase the
	// cost of flushing from one layer to the next.
	//
	// TODO: Depending on how we flush buffers, the effect of this may be fairly

	// and then copy out blocks, we might be mostly limited by how many counts
	// we can keep at once.
