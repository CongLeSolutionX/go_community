// TODO: We spent a lot of time shuffling pointers around. Would it be better to
// just have two layers, where the per-P buffers on the top layer are sized
// proportionally to the heap to amortize the number of addresses written to
// each heap buffer on each flush, and the per-heap region buffers on the bottom
// layer are sized to achieve a target dartboard density? This would involve a
// deeper sort to flush a per-P buffer, but we could do that in a
// cache-conscious way, and potentially more contention on the heap buffers, but
// maybe Ps or groups of Ps reserve blocks, or we have more than one buffer per
// heap region.
