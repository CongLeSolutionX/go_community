// go2go is a command for trying out generic Go code.
// It supports a small number of commands similar to cmd/go.
//
// Usage:
//
//	go2go <command> [arguments]
//
// The commands are:
//
//	build      translate and then run "go build packages"
//	run        translate and then run a list of files
//      test       translate and then run "go test packages"
//      translate  translate .go2 files into .go files for listed packages
//
// A package is expected to contain .go2 files but no .go files.
//
// Non-local imported packages will be first looked up using the GO2PATH
// environment variable, which should point to a GOPATH-like directory.
// For example, import "x" will first look for GO2PATHDIR/src/x,
// for each colon-separated component in GO2PATH. If not found in GO2PATH,
// imports will be looked up in the usual way. If an import includes
// .go2 files, they will be translated into .go files.
//
// There is a sample GO2PATH in cmd/go2go/testdata/go2path. It provides
// several packages that serve as examples of using generics, and may
// be useful in experimenting with your own generic code.
//
// Translation into standard Go requires generating Go code with mangled names.
// The mangled names will always include Odia (Oriya) digits, such as рнж and рно.
// Do not use Oriya digits in identifiers in your own code.
