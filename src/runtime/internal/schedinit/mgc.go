// TODO(rsc): The code having to do with the heap bitmap needs very serious cleanup.
// It has gotten completely out of control.

// Garbage collector (GC).
//
// The GC runs concurrently with mutator threads, is type accurate (aka precise), allows multiple
// GC thread to run in parallel. It is a concurrent mark and sweep that uses a write barrier. It is
// non-generational and non-compacting. Allocation is done using size segregated per P allocation
// areas to minimize fragmentation while eliminating locks in the common case.
//
// The algorithm decomposes into several steps.
// This is a high level description of the algorithm being used. For an overview of GC a good
// place to start is Richard Jones' gchandbook.org.
//
// The algorithm's intellectual heritage includes Dijkstra's on-the-fly algorithm, see
// Edsger W. Dijkstra, Leslie Lamport, A. J. Martin, C. S. Scholten, and E. F. M. Steffens. 1978.
// On-the-fly garbage collection: an exercise in cooperation. Commun. ACM 21, 11 (November 1978),
// 966-975.
// For journal quality proofs that these steps are complete, correct, and terminate see
// Hudson, R., and Moss, J.E.B. Copying Garbage Collection without stopping the world.

//  0. Set phase = GCscan from GCoff.
//  1. Wait for all P's to acknowledge phase change.
//         At this point all goroutines have passed through a GC safepoint and
//         know we are in the GCscan phase.
//  2. GC scans all goroutine stacks, mark and enqueues all encountered pointers
//       (marking avoids most duplicate enqueuing but races may produce benign duplication).
//       Preempted goroutines are scanned before P schedules next goroutine.
//  3. Set phase = GCmark.
//  4. Wait for all P's to acknowledge phase change.
//  5. Now write barrier marks and enqueues black, grey, or white to white pointers.
//       Malloc still allocates white (non-marked) objects.
//  6. Meanwhile GC transitively walks the heap marking reachable objects.
//  7. When GC finishes marking heap, it preempts P's one-by-one and
//       retakes partial wbufs (filled by write barrier or during a stack scan of the goroutine
//       currently scheduled on the P).
//  8. Once the GC has exhausted all available marking work it sets phase = marktermination.
//  9. Wait for all P's to acknowledge phase change.
// 10. Malloc now allocates black objects, so number of unmarked reachable objects
//        monotonically decreases.
// 11. GC preempts P's one-by-one taking partial wbufs and marks all unmarked yet
//        reachable objects.
// 12. When GC completes a full cycle over P's and discovers no new grey
//         objects, (which means all reachable objects are marked) set phase = GCsweep.
// 13. Wait for all P's to acknowledge phase change.
// 14. Now malloc allocates white (but sweeps spans before use).
//         Write barrier becomes nop.
// 15. GC does background sweeping, see description below.
// 16. When sweeping is complete set phase to GCoff.
// 17. When sufficient allocation has taken place replay the sequence starting at 0 above,
//         see discussion of GC rate below.

// Changing phases.
// Phases are changed by setting the gcphase to the next phase and possibly calling ackgcphase.
// All phase action must be benign in the presence of a change.
// Starting with GCoff
// GCoff to GCscan
//     GSscan scans stacks and globals greying them and never marks an object black.
//     Once all the P's are aware of the new phase they will scan gs on preemption.
//     This means that the scanning of preempted gs can't start until all the Ps
//     have acknowledged.
// GCscan to GCmark
//     GCMark turns on the write barrier which also only greys objects. No scanning
//     of objects (making them black) can happen until all the Ps have acknowledged
//     the phase change.
// GCmark to GCmarktermination
//     The only change here is that we start allocating black so the Ps must acknowledge
//     the change before we begin the termination algorithm
// GCmarktermination to GSsweep
//     Object currently on the freelist must be marked black for this to work.
//     Are things on the free lists black or white? How does the sweep phase work?

// Concurrent sweep.
// The sweep phase proceeds concurrently with normal program execution.
// The heap is swept span-by-span both lazily (when a goroutine needs another span)
// and concurrently in a background goroutine (this helps programs that are not CPU bound).
// However, at the end of the stop-the-world GC phase we don't know the size of the live heap,
// and so next_gc calculation is tricky and happens as follows.
// At the end of the stop-the-world phase next_gc is conservatively set based on total
// heap size; all spans are marked as "needs sweeping".
// Whenever a span is swept, next_gc is decremented by GOGC*newly_freed_memory.
// The background sweeper goroutine simply sweeps spans one-by-one bringing next_gc
// closer to the target value. However, this is not enough to avoid over-allocating memory.
// Consider that a goroutine wants to allocate a new span for a large object and
// there are no free swept spans, but there are small-object unswept spans.
// If the goroutine naively allocates a new span, it can surpass the yet-unknown
// target next_gc value. In order to prevent such cases (1) when a goroutine needs
// to allocate a new small-object span, it sweeps small-object spans for the same
// object size until it frees at least one object; (2) when a goroutine needs to
// allocate large-object span from heap, it sweeps spans until it frees at least
// that many pages into heap. Together these two measures ensure that we don't surpass
// target next_gc value by a large margin. There is an exception: if a goroutine sweeps
// and frees two nonadjacent one-page spans to the heap, it will allocate a new two-page span,
// but there can still be other one-page unswept spans which could be combined into a
// two-page span.
// It's critical to ensure that no operations proceed on unswept spans (that would corrupt
// mark bits in GC bitmap). During GC all mcaches are flushed into the central cache,
// so they are empty. When a goroutine grabs a new span into mcache, it sweeps it.
// When a goroutine explicitly frees an object or sets a finalizer, it ensures that
// the span is swept (either by sweeping it, or by waiting for the concurrent sweep to finish).
// The finalizer goroutine is kicked off only when all spans are swept.
// When the next GC starts, it sweeps all not-yet-swept spans (if any).

// GC rate.
// Next GC is after we've allocated an extra amount of memory proportional to
// the amount already in use. The proportion is controlled by GOGC environment variable
// (100 by default). If GOGC=100 and we're using 4M, we'll GC again when we get to 8M
// (this mark is tracked in next_gc variable). This keeps the GC cost in linear
// proportion to the allocation cost. Adjusting GOGC just changes the linear constant
// (and also the amount of extra memory used).
