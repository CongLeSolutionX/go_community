package base

// MemProfileRate controls the fraction of memory allocations
// that are recorded and reported in the memory profile.
// The profiler aims to sample an average of
// one allocation per MemProfileRate bytes allocated.
//
// To include every allocated block in the profile, set MemProfileRate to 1.
// To turn off profiling entirely, set MemProfileRate to 0.
//
// The tools that process the memory profiles assume that the
// profile rate is constant across the lifetime of the program
// and equal to the current value.  Programs that change the
// memory profiling rate should do so just once, as early as
// possible in the execution of the program (for example,
// at the beginning of main).
var MemProfileRate int = 512 * 1024
