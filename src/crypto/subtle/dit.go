// WithDataIndependentTiming enables architecture specific features which ensure
// that the timing of specific instructions is independent of their inputs
// before executing f. On f returning it disables these features.
//
// WithDataIndependentTiming should only be used when f is written to make use
// of constant-time operations. WithDataIndependentTiming does not make
// variable-time code constant-time.
//
// WithDataIndependentTiming locks the current goroutine to the OS thread for
// the duration of f. Calls to WithDataIndependentTiming may be nested.
//
// On Arm64 processors with FEAT_DIT, WithDataIndependentTiming enables
// PSTATE.DIT. See https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ka005181/1-0/?lang=en.
//
// On all other architectures WithDataIndependentTiming executes f immediately
// with no other side-effects.
