// for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence
// of an event.
//
// Each Cond has an associated Locker L (often a *Mutex or *RWMutex),
// which must be held when changing the condition and
// when calling the Wait method.
//
// A Cond can be created as part of other structures.
// A Cond must not be copied after first use.

// of the calling goroutine. After later resuming execution,
// Wait locks c.L before returning. Unlike in other systems,
// Wait cannot return unless awoken by Broadcast or Signal.

// typically cannot assume that the condition is true when
// Wait returns. Instead, the caller should Wait in a loop:
//
//    c.L.Lock()
//    for !condition() {
