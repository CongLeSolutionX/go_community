      "message": "Thanks for the CL. I originally had the idea that we could preempt the stack bounds check prologue and restart at function entry. But I\u0027m not sure this is really worth doing. If we actually make a call to morestack and we want to preempt, morestack would preempt anyway. So we don\u0027t really need to asynchronously preempt it. There are possibilities that we don\u0027t actually preempt\n- (on some architectures) the comparison instruction is included in the non-preemptible range. The comparison could fail and we may not actually call morestack.\n\nThis is very short and cannot repeat. Unlike other instruction sequences which, if appear in a loop, we may hit it over and over again, this code only run once. I don\u0027t think it really matters for this code to be non-preemptible. Do you see it help in a real program?\n\n- the prologue after the morestack call, like the unspilling code.\n\nThis probably should be just preemptible (like this CL does). Perhaps we only do this part for this CL. Thanks.",
