      "message": "I had interpreted these tests as specifically validating that the fast variants are used, which `mapassign.*` would defeat.\n\nBut with a fresh set of eyes, I suppose this is more about checking liveness with the key returned from a call directly in the map access expression.\n\nDo we have/want any tests specifically about whether fast variants are used? Those would probably be best in test/codegen/maps.go, which doesn\u0027t quite contain any such tests.",
