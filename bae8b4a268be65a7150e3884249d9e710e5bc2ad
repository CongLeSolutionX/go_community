      "message": "I don\u0027t think this change is needed: The reference to the \"multi-valued assignment form of the receive operator\" is meant as a hint that the receive operator has this capability, it\u0027s not meant as a precise specification of it. That specification is in the section on the receive operator (and there\u0027s a link). Here we are here in the section defining channel types, where we simply give an overview of some of the channel-related operations. There\u0027s no need to duplicate the details of the receive operator.\n\nPlease abandon. Thanks.",
