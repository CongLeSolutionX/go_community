(Run with -test.benchmem.)\n\nMy go binary is 0.5% bigger.\n\nUnfortunately I think this falls squarely in the \"not sure if it is worth it\" category. The speed gains aren\u0027t huge, and the space usage is not all that much worse. This makes deciding hard 😞\n\nI would lean toward not doing it, though. Places which concatenate strings a lot are probably not doing string addition. They are doing []byte appends, bytes.Buffer operations, or something else with more control over allocation. But even cold string addition could well pollute the icache.",

Can\u0027t this CL fall into the \"housekeeping\" category, removing old and obsolete \"corner-cased\" parts of the code? Thank you in advance!",
