      "message": "Not worth an edit, but for future reference: The \"this\" that begins the final sentence has no clear referent. Of course we can work it out--that\u0027s why it\u0027s not worth an edit--but it would be clearer to avoid the issue: \"This approach\" or \"This algorithm\".\n\nThises at the start of sentences are often ambiguous because, as in this case, there is actually no subject of a previous sentence to which the This can refer. Instead, we must make one up.",
