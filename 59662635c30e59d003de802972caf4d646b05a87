      "message": "I haven\u0027t looked into tests (aside from using it later in this CL stack). I agree that the new functions should end up with as much testing as the existing ones; I haven\u0027t surveyed how thorough those are.\n\nIn the end, arm64 support would be great, thank you! I haven\u0027t done any work on that; my main linux/arm64 test machine these days is a Raspberry Pi 5 (with 4 cores), so doesn\u0027t show the same sort of collapse we get on machines with dozens of cores. (It looks like `gotip-linux-arm64` builders have 8 cores.) But the reason to add Xchg8 is in support of the current implementation of the \"spinbit\" mutex implementation in CL 601597. If we end up with a different approach there, we might not need Xchg8 on any architecture.",
