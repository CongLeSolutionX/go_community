      "message": "In the object file format, I went back and forth about whether Gotype is an Aux or a field in goobj2.Sym. I chose the former because (1) not all symbols have Aux (therefore save some space) (2) goobj2.Sym doesn\u0027t have any reference to other symbols, i.e. it doesn\u0027t need any index structure. We could consider moving Gotype to goobj2.Sym, if there is a clear benefit. In particular, if we want to read it in preload, we might want to do that.",

      "message": "yah, I was wondering the same thing.  I think you made the right choice though; I added some code to my linker stats patch to see how many symbols have a defined Gotype field. For kubernetese hyperkube is is 23732 out of 1398008 (reachable) syms, so a bit less than 2%. So my feeling is that this is the right way to go.",
