      "message": "The lowering pass can generate more constants or do more simplifications, so these rules are still useful. Long ago when I wrote them, I did a coverage of the rules and most of them are indeed fired during make.bash or all.bash.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the lowering pass is not the bottleneck of the compiler speed, and these rules don\u0027t cost too much.",
