      "message": "slightly concerned about the performance impact of this. right now gcTrigger doesn\u0027t appear to cost very much, but we\u0027ll see. I assume it\u0027ll look something like gcController.revise (called at about the same cadence, but not during a GC cycle). it\u0027s not very expensive overall, and I suspect worth it, but important to be aware of. the next change at least tries to help a little by avoiding the floating-point operations, not sure it makes that much of a difference, though.",
