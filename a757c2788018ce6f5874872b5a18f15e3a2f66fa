Even if `uname -m` doesn\u0027t work presumably there is some way to detect the processor.\n\nOr if AIX really only works on ppc64 then this is OK.",

      "message": "AIX only works on ppc and ppc64be. However, with IBM, we have decided to not port Golang for aix/ppc. It might be the case in the future, but not before 1 or 2 years, and still we don\u0027t thing it\u0027ll ever happen. \n\nSo I thing it\u0027s OK in a first instance to have it that way.",
