      "message": "I have concerns about this white-list. It seems complete for standard headers, but I can imagine APIs using custom headers that hold authentication tokens (and I have vague recollections about needing to do so for some API I used in the past).\n\nIf some API was using \"My-Custom-Auth-Token\", I find it dangerous that we silently leak security-sensitive information.\n\nJust throwing ideas around. Should copying of headers be an opt-in feature?",

      "message": "It\u0027s already an opt-in feature: the only interesting thing the Client does compared to the Transport is redirects.\n\nIf you don\u0027t want redirects, don\u0027t use Transport.\n\nAnd if you\u0027re sending your super-secret \"My-Custom-Auth-Token\" over HTTP in the clear or over HTTPS to a server you don\u0027t trust, why are you sending it auth tokens? If it\u0027s going to redirect you maliciously it could just as well send those tokens to whoever it wants itself.\n\nI agree this list is a little arbitrary, but it seems to be what others kinda do (Chrome, curl, urllib2). Not that any of this is written down anywhere.\n\nThe reason this bug has been dormant for 3 years is because nobody wanted to make a decision.\n\nI decided this was reasonably arbitrary if we have to pick something arbitrary.\n\nIf you have a counter proposal, propose confidently. I want to submit something.",
