      "message": "I have concerns about this white-list. It seems complete for standard headers, but I can imagine APIs using custom headers that hold authentication tokens (and I have vague recollections about needing to do so for some API I used in the past).\n\nIf some API was using \"My-Custom-Auth-Token\", I find it dangerous that we silently leak security-sensitive information.\n\nJust throwing ideas around. Should copying of headers be an opt-in feature?",
