      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is good enough. It\u0027s really easy to fix one specific error scenario, but make it worse in all other cases. What happens if the code is \"struct }\", or \"interface m() }\" etc? The parser will exit the struct/interface parsing functions but then will also be unsynchronized. It\u0027s really hard to get this right for most common cases.\n\nIf writing \"interface\" without \"{}\" is a common case, what should happen is that we recognize it as if it were \"interface{}\" (correct node) but report a parser error. But I am not convinced this is a common case.\n\nI think this needs a) more test cases showing the effect on different code scenarios, b) probably a bit smarter logic in case of a failure.\n",
