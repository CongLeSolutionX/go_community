IIUC, collisions act as if neither name is present, whereas shadowing causes the higher name to appear and the lower name to disappear.",

      "message": "The comment says it: \"since they will hide any method further down\".\n\nThis is not general lookup, this is just method lookup/method set computation. Any field at depth d will shadow any other field OR method with the same name at a lower (as in deeper) depth (d+1, d+2, ...). Those methods will not be in the method set. That was the bug.",
