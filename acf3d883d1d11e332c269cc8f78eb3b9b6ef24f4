      "message": "Per informal discussion of last week, I am proposing that we check in this package as is and then review on a file-by-file basis as we go along as it\u0027s a huge amount of code. It\u0027s originally based on go/types (in 2018), was modified to implement the generics prototype, and then modified to work with the syntax package rather than the go/* packages.\n\nReviewing the diffs will be more painful than reading the code.\n\nI\u0027ve excluded the testdata directory which contains most of the tests that have not changed. I will add them in subsequent CLs again. Where they have not changed (from go/types) they don\u0027t need to be reviewed.\n\nThere examples and fixedbugs directory contain generics-related test, so this commit is not without any tests.\n\n",
