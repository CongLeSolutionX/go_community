      "message": "Most of the size increases were due to having two epilogues instead of one.\nI hacked a change to detect whether the epilogue is large, and share it if so.\nMost equality functions are now better. There are a few regressions, but nothing major. Some of the remaining ones are due to imperfect epilogue detection. For instances, equality for a struct with a struct field, with the inner struct containing a string, isn\u0027t detected properly (because the inner equality is not expanded yet at the point I look for calls).\n",
