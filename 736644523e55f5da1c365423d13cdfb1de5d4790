      "message": "Thanks for working on this, but I don\u0027t think this is the right place to add this information.\n\nBefore Go 1.16, \u0027go help modules\u0027 contained a fairly long description of modules, but it was difficult to read in a terminal, and it couldn\u0027t contain links and formatted examples.\n\nWe changed it to be much more concise. It now contains 1) a very brief definition of modules, 2) links to HTML tutorial and reference pages, and 3) a privacy notice for networked services.\n\nPlease read through the tutorials linked from https://golang.org/doc/tutorial/create-module. If something is missing, please edit those instead. The source for those pages is in https://go.googlesource.com/website and mirrored at https://github.com/golang/website.",
