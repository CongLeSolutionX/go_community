      "message": "Hmmm, this changes a cast to a dereference, which doesn\u0027t seem right. It seems the `void *port` arg is from pthread_create at line 204, which passes `(void*)port_set` as the arg, which is casted from `uintptr_t port_set \u003d (uintptr_t)mach_exception_handler_port_set;`.\n\nMaybe here we cast to `uintptr_t` first then to `mach_port_t`, which probably will suppress the warning. Or we pass a reference (which seems more complicated than necessary). Or we just use the global variable `mach_exception_handler_port_set` without the parameter.",
