      "message": "A minute is a pretty long time, and we want to make sure this can be cancelled with ^C or a timeout, so make sure to wire in the ctx passed to workerServer.fuzz here. You can set a timeout on top of that with context.WithTimeout.\n\nThis will probably be different than the child context we create inside workerServer.fuzz; I think that timeout is only 100ms.",
