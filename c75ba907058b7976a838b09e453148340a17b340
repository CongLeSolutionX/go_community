Could we do the same? Also, this may cause concurrency problems, e.g. cloning to external symbol changes global index mapping.",

      "message": "Thanks. You have a point about the concurrency issues.\n\nThe modification is in the next patch; archreloc2 seems to want to convert R_ARM64_GOTPCREL into R_ADDRARM64 to work around a Darwin linker bug (circa 2015). \n\nI am not sure I can apply the same trick that you used in CL 231217 since elfreloc1 already seems to have a separate case for R_ARM64_GOTPCREL? Maybe that code is dead given what\u0027s happening in archreloc. \n\nI\u0027ll poke at this a bit in the next patch and see if I can remove the need for the udpate.",

      "message": "Correction, the workaround was for a bug in the BFD linker, not Darwin.\n\nI tested an alternate version of the next patch that no longer includes the workaround -- that seems to pass the shared tests on the builder. Given the age of the bug in question (this was binutils 2.6, and we\u0027re now on 2.34) I think it would be better to revamp the patch to remove the workaround, meaning that this signature change patch won\u0027t be needed. Will update shortly.",
