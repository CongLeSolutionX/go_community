Pointer in particular makes life so much easier.\n\nI wonder if it might be worth declaring a generic interface that covers all of those new types:\n\ntype ValueOf[T any] interface {\n\tLoad() T\n\tStore(T)\n\tSwap(T) T\n\tCompareAndSwap(T, T) bool\n}\n\n(I don\u0027t know what the preferred spelling for \"Of\" types is these days).\n\nUnfortunately these types aren\u0027t automatically convertible to that interface (cf https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41176) but I think the type is still useful (and makes it clear that they all conform to the same pattern too).\n",
