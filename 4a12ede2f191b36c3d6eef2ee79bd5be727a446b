      "message": "I don\u0027t see how having \".\" in symbol names makes the external linker see them as \"Forwarder RVA exports\".\n\nI don\u0027t recall ever reading about \"Forwarder RVA exports\". So I am not an expert.\n\nBut I don\u0027t see how these references clarify your point.\n\nFor example, error messages in\n\nhttps://sourceware.org/git/?p\u003dbinutils-gdb.git;a\u003dblob;f\u003dld/pe-dll.c;h\u003de7b82ba6ffadf74dc1b9ee71dc13d48336941e51;hb\u003dHEAD#l972\n\nsays\n\n einfo (_(\"%X%P: cannot export %s: symbol not found\\n\"),\n \nwhich is different from error message I see and you see as per\n\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/go-build-log/5a6a4464/windows-386-2008_20291edc.log\n\nCannot export go:buildid: symbol not found\n\nIt would be nice to actually see source of the external linker we all run (including builders). But I never managed to find it. Forget about ability to build gcc myself for debugging cases like this one.",
