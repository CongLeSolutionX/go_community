Your feedback on this is welcome.\n* I wasn\u0027t sure if I should minimize symbols to \"$\". Maybe that is too American centric? \"\u003d\" is another option.\n* In issue golang/go#48129 Russ Cox suggested a different algorithm for minimizing. If you would prefer that algorithm I am happy to change this.",
