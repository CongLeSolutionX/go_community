Otherwise, please address any problems and update the GitHub PR. When complete, mark this comment as \u0027Done\u0027 and click the [blue \u0027Reply\u0027 button](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GerritBot#i-left-a-reply-to-a-comment-in-gerrit-but-no-one-but-me-can-see-it) above.\n\nPossible problems detected:\n  1. Do you have the right bug reference format? For this repo, the format is usually \u0027Fixes #12345\u0027 or \u0027Updates #12345\u0027 (without a period) at the end of the commit message.\n\nTo edit the commit message, see instructions [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GerritBot/#how-does-gerritbot-determine-the-final-commit-message). For guidelines on commit messages for the Go project, see [here](https://go.dev/doc/contribute#commit_messages).\n\n\n(In general for Gerrit code reviews, the CL author is expected to close out each piece of feedback by marking it as \u0027Done\u0027 if implemented as suggested or otherwise reply to each review comment.
