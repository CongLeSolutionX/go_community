      "message": "To simplify theses we would need to be sure they can always eat raw Mod operations.\nTheses already run in late opt `\u0026\u0026 v.Block.Func.pass.name !\u003d \"opt\"` and from what I got in an other CL you were against the idea of relying on rules ordering, so I can\u0027t move theses above the strength reduction rules so they run first. I think it would be overkill to create two late opt passes to sequence `x%c \u003d\u003d 0` with strength reduction.",
