      "message": "While this code successfully parses a multi-value RDN, by merely appending to Names, it strips the set grouping. That is, ToRDNSequence after parsing such a certificate will not result in a multi-value RDN.\n\nAs noted previously, without a breaking change to pkix.Name or the introduction of new fields/methods, I do not see an obvious way to preserve the multi-value nature of the RDN.\n\nWhile multi-valued RDNs may not be common, they are clearly part of the RDN standard in RFC 5280, not erroneous certificate constructions like Bug #16836 seems to suggest.\n\nIf you decide to keep the parsing logic, I would at least add a note documenting the loss of information about the multi-value nature of an RDN.",
