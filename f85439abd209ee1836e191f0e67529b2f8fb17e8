Previously\nrdwake would occupy the left most 16 bits during the comparison,\nbut now it\u0027ll be compared to directly.\n\nAlso we had that previous sanity check:\n   if rdwake \u003e 0xFFFF || wrwake \u003e 0xFFFF {\n\tthrow(\"netpolldescriptor: invalid fd number\")\n   }\nor is the probability of those ranges low that it was just being an extraneous check?",
