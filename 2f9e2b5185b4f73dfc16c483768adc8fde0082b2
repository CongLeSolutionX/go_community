      "message": "[+Cherry for real this time]\n\nCherry: For context, today the `cgo -dynimport` tool writes //go:cgo_* directives that cmd/compile copies into its .o output. Only the linker cares about those directives, so having them as cmd/compile inputs unnecessarily limits build parallelism.\n\nThis CL is trying to improve that by having `cgo -dynimport` directly write out a .o file that the linker can process. But the minimal .o file it\u0027s currently writing out is crashing the linker.\n\nI suspect including an empty (i.e., 0 LSym) object data section might work, but I also thought we should check with you first in case you have a better suggestion. Thanks.",
