      "message": "Is there any way we could test also having a sub-pointer-sized tail in the copy? It\u0027s tricky because it will definitely create bad pointer values... Maybe if s0 was a struct with both a pointer array and 7 scalar bytes and you copied from the middle of it, always starting at a pointer, but pulling in different amounts of the scalar tail?",
