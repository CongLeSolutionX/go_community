      "message": "Is there any way we could test also having a sub-pointer-sized tail in the copy? It\u0027s tricky because it will definitely create bad pointer values... Maybe if s0 was a struct with both a pointer array and 7 scalar bytes and you copied from the middle of it, always starting at a pointer, but pulling in different amounts of the scalar tail?",

      "message": "This should wait for the goroutine to clean up either using a sync.WaitGroup, or this could set ready to, say 2 when the loop exits and the loop below could run until ready is 2 (I like that latter, since it gets the most out of the test without depending on the loops running at the same rate).",
