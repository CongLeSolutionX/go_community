      "message": "Yeah, I think so. Renamed CallPartExpr and MethodExpr\u0027s fields to \"Method\" and SelectorExpr to \"Selection\" (since it can be either a field or method).\n\nI originally thought there would be value in having the fields all named the same thing, but I was reluctant to call SelectorExpr\u0027s field either Field or Method, since either could be misleading. But I didn\u0027t really like Obj either. These are definitely better. Thanks for the prodding to think more about it.",
