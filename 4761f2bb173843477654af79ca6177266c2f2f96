      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem correct. `cfg.GOPROXY` can include multiple entries in order of precedence. Instead, check the URLs in the list returned by a call to `proxyList()`: `direct`, `noproxy`, and `https://` URLs should be considered ‚Äúdownloading‚Äù, but `file://` can be considered ‚Äúcopying‚Äù.\n\nBut that could get confusing too, because if the list includes a `file://` URL with fallback to an `https://` URL we would still say ‚Äúdownloading‚Äù even if we don\u0027t use the fallback. So I guess we need a different approach to address the UX issue. üòï",
