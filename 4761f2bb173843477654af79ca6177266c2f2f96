      "message": "This doesn\u0027t seem correct. `cfg.GOPROXY` can include multiple entries in order of precedence. Instead, check the URLs in the list returned by a call to `proxyList()`: `direct`, `noproxy`, and `https://` URLs should be considered ‚Äúdownloading‚Äù, but `file://` can be considered ‚Äúcopying‚Äù.\n\nBut that could get confusing too, because if the list includes a `file://` URL with fallback to an `https://` URL we would still say ‚Äúdownloading‚Äù even if we don\u0027t use the fallback. So I guess we need a different approach to address the UX issue. üòï",

      "message": "You are right, I double checked the list returned by proxyList(): and \"copying\" and \"downloading\" always appear together when file:// URL is used as high priority. Rolling back my changes, we actually told the user \"downloading\" before calling proxyList():\n\nSo I now have a new idea. Add an interface method \"CheckFileProxy\" in \"Repo\". After calling proxyList():, check whether the file:// URL can be called to decide whether to inform the user whether it is \"downloading\" or \"copying\". ü§î\n\nBut I don‚Äôt know if this change direction is feasible. I am still in the evaluation and implementation stage. I may update the PR in the near future. I want to express my thoughts first. If there is anything that can be improved, please give me your advice.",
