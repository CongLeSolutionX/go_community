I changed that.\n\n\u003e Also this doesn\u0027t need to use R25, as we are not jumping to the function prologue. In fact, I\u0027m not sure it is safe to clobber R25.\n\nYes, I use REGTMP to jump instead. R25 must be used to get the address of the current function. And I think R25 should not be used in regalloc in PIC code. Should I delete it from register set for regalloc?",
