I changed that.\n\n\u003e Also this doesn\u0027t need to use R25, as we are not jumping to the function prologue. In fact, I\u0027m not sure it is safe to clobber R25.\n\nYes, I use REGTMP to jump instead. R25 must be used to get the address of the current function. And I think R25 should not be used in regalloc in PIC code. Should I delete it from register set for regalloc?",

      "message": "\u003e R25 must be used to get the address of the current function.\n\nI\u0027m not sure why it must be R25. I think it can be any register. However, looking at the  instruction sequence it looks like  it needs a register other than REGTMP. It  needs to be a fixed register so the register allocator can reserve it. If you like R25, that is fine.\n\nYes, you\u0027ll need to reserve it in the register allocator.",
