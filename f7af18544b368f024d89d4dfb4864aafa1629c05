      "message": "I believe this is too complex. In addition, this forces an extra call to FromSlash and volumeNameLen during the common case. It still cannot be used to create a UNC path because it requires the first element to be a full UNC path. What does the added complexity fix over patch set 10? I think we should just be fixing the one case where the first element is a slash.",
