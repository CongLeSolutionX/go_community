      "message": "Hi Matt:  let me know what you think of this change.  I think it is quite a bit clearer if the methods of the interfaces are accessed via AllMethods(), rather than Fields(), but it does require a number of changes.  I\u0027m also fine if you don\u0027t like this cleanup -- in that case, I will at least put comments on Fields/Fields() and allMethods/AllMethods() to clarify what Fields means for interfaces, and that allMethods is not used for interfaces.\n",
