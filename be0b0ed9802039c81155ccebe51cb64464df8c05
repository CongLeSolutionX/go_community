      "message": "For nested const declarations (e.g., see golang.org/issue/15550), we need a separate constState for each nesting level. I could make it into a noder field, but then it would need to be a slice, and noder.decls would need to push/pop from it anyway.\n\nAs is seems cleaner to me, but happy to experiment if you disagree.",

      "message": "I think it\u0027d be a bit clearer to check all the lengths up front. E.g. something like:\n\nmax :\u003d len(names)\nswitch {\ncase len(values) \u003e len(names):\n  yyerror(\"extra...\")\ncase len(names) \u003e len(values):\n  yyerror(\"missing...\")\n  max \u003d len(values)\n}\n\n// Even when there\u0027s a length mismatch, process as many as we can.\nfor i :\u003d 0; i \u003c max; i++ {\n  n :\u003d names[i]\n  v :\u003d values[i]\n  // ...\n}\n\nBut I don\u0027t feel strongly.

I was also a little worried about moving yyerror linenos around, so decided to leave as is.\n\nBut I\u0027ll continue thinking about it. I plan on cleaning up variter too, which uses a somewhat similar idiom to this.",
