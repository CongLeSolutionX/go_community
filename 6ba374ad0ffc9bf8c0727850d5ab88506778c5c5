All chans notify... the question is what they notify you of.\n\nNotice below it says:\n\n    case \u003c-reqDone:\n\nSo you know what that case represents.  If it were:\n\n   case \u003c-stuff:\n\nOr:\n\n   case \u003c-ch0:\n\nOr:\n\n    case \u003c-notifyChan:\n\n.... it\u0027s not as obvious what it means.",
