      "message": "It probably makes sense to make rconv keyed by architecture, instead of the ranges, so every architecture can use all the bits. But I don\u0027t understand why it needs the Addr. It is printing a register, and only it, so it shouldn\u0027t need other fields. If it needs other fields, it probably should be a different Type.",
