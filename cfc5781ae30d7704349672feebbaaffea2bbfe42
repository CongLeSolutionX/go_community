      "message": "Why is this changing? From the check below it makes it sound like you (and now the compiler) believe that\n\ni, sa[i] \u003d 1, 42\n\nshould be like\n\ni \u003d 1\nsa[1] \u003d 42\n\nbut that\u0027s wrong. The whole point of the parallel assignment is that they happen in parallel: the i in sa[i] is the i before the assignment. So the second effect should be sa[0] \u003d 42, not sa[1] \u003d 42.",
