      "message": "So in the code structure before this CL and even before the\nprevious ones, if the io.Reader wasn\u0027t an *io.LimitedReader\nwhose underlying reader was an *os.File, we wouldn\u0027t know\nwhat the filesize was.\n\nYou can verify what am talking about by invoking sendFile directly\nwith a big *os.File instead of an *io.LimitedReader and you\u0027ll see that we don\u0027t even check the size n \u003d\u003d 0, which isn\u0027t correct. I guess we haven\u0027t yet used an *os.File directly but this approach simplifies it and I even have a test to verify it -- I\u0027ll delete the test like you had previously requested since it is a heavy one.\n\nThis CL stats the *os.File if it wasn\u0027t passed in as the underlying reader, i.e. sendFile(fd, *os.File)",

This works just fine with having n set to 0.\n\nsendFile even goes further to also support os.File wrapped around with io.LimitedReader.
