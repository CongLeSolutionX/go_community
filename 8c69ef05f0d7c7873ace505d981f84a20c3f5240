      "message": "Cool.  I much prefer your phrasing over mine... \"on one condition\" ;)\n\nMy \"condition\" (really just an idea): \n- We use sub-headings or horizontal lines or something to divide \"compiler binaries\" into 3 clear subsections.\n\nI struggled with how to edit this \"compiler binaries\" section in a clear and concise way, because this section feels like 3 sections in 1, and it initially took me many re-readings to discern where exactly one sub-section ends and the next begins.\n\n(The sections I see are \"use a binary release\", \"use 1.4 source\", and \"cross-compile using 1.4 source\".)\n\nThat is why I went through contortions to express: \"if-and-only-if you took the build-from-git-src option...\".\n\nAll 3 sections could benefit from a bit more explicitness, but I only have experience with the \"use 1.4 source\" section right now.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nWe could do \"bulleted paragraphs\", like: https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment\n\nWe could do \"h3\" subheadings, like the per-OS ones at: https://golang.org/doc/install#install\n\nLooking over a handful of pages, it seems like \"h3\" subheadings are the typical pattern in these docs.\n\nWhat do you think?  Do you also discern approximately 3 subheadings?  I realize that the \"1.4 source\" subsection will then be a bigger subsection than the others, but maybe this will induce other people to see an opportunity to add some bonus touch-ups to the other subsections.",
