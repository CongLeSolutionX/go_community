      "message": "The effect of this is to keep flagEmbedRO and to not add flagStickyRO.  So one effect I see is that calling Method on the result will drop the flagEmbedRO flag, and so we can get a result that is not marked RO at all.  And then we will be permitted to Call that method, which should not be permitted since it is derived from an unexported field.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

If a field is flagged with only flagEmbedRO, then it is an anonymous field with no unexported ancestors, thus its exported fields including exported methods are exported. I think this is what the comment \"Clear flagEmbedRO\" in Method says.A\n\nIs there any exported methods in reflect leaking unexported methods to caller ? I did find one.",
