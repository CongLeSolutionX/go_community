      "message": "I took another look at the CL in which the test was originally added, and realized that the test as written (both today and in my first draft of this CL) only exercises the \"unshared\" codepath, but the original bug is more closely related to the “shared” one.\n\n(If the original comparison before CL 100840 had been `ctxErr !\u003d nil` instead of `ctxErr \u003d\u003d context.DeadlineExceeded`, then the bug still would have existed, but it would have been racier and the test would not have caught it.)\n\nReworked the test to bias toward the “shared” case.
