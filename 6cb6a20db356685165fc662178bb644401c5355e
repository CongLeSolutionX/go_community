      "message": "I wanted to test the error values, and that meant that I had to move the test so that it was only built for systems that define syscall.EBADF.  The earlier version of the test only tested for failure, not for the specific error value.  Since the old version of the test skipped the running of test on windows, nacl, and js, the test is still run on all the systems for which it was run before, except for one: plan9.  I don\u0027t think we need to worry about that case very much.",
