Could be related to a recent iOS update. Could also depend on how JPEGs are exported from an iPhone.\n\nThank you! 🙏",

The test should fail before the change and pass after the change.  I would expect this pull request to include a change to image/jpeg/reader_test.go, perhaps with a new testdata file.  Thanks.",
