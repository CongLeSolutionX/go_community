      "message": "Given that this has to plumb through to obj, shouldn\u0027t Lineno live in obj or perhaps in some new package of its own? I don\u0027t see why an alias would even be necessary here to clean this up significantly.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the casts this CL adds at package boundaries shouldn\u0027t be necessary, and wouldn\u0027t be if there was a single common Lineno type. That would make this CL a fair bit smaller.",

      "message": "I agree with all points.\n\nI just think it\u0027s easier to do this incrementally. In a next CL I was planning to move the Lineno type out (which is mostly a global rename that can be done automatically, and introduction of necessary import).\n\nI simply prefer to work in small incremental steps.\n\nIf you like me to produce the other CLs first, I can do that.",

      "message": "Okay, that\u0027s fine. I figured this CL itself would be simpler if, when the Lineno type was first introduced, it was introduced in the same package it will ultimately live in. Then you wouldn\u0027t have to introduce a bunch of casts just to remove them later. But if this step fits better into your overall plan, then I\u0027m happy.",
