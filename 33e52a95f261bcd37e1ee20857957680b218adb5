      "message": "It\u0027s not obvious to me that this is always correct.  This test means that an extra M was created.  At the time that we are executing this code, though, that M may be in use, and we may not have created another extra M yet (see the comment for the `needm` function in runtime/proc.go).  In that case I think we might incorrectly report a deadlock.  I\u0027m not sure, though.",
