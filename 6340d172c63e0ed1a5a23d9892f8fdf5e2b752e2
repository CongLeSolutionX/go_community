IR is already hard enough to even construct correctly, and we have a worse track record with implementing transforms correctly. E.g., the static initializer optimization (CL 450136) is the most recent IR transformation to be added (back in November), it still needed multiple fixes (CLs 451376, 451555, 452676, 453315, 461686). Or recall we stopped backporting generics fixes to Go 1.18, because each time we tried to fix an issue with its transforms, we\u0027d break something else.\n\nThat\u0027s why the defining essence of the unified frontend\u0027s design was to avoid transforms, and instead to favor simple, universal IR constructs.

We need to be able to detect/report relevant loops, and the 3-clause rewrite is messy (over 1/3 of LOC in loopvar.go) no matter where we implement it.  That\u0027s 80% of the complexity that remains, somewhere (the 20% remainder where declarations and initializations are sorted properly ought to go away with OREDCL nodes -- on the other hand we\u0027d need to implement OREDCL nodes).\n\nTo remove the need to detect/report loops, I think we need to wait for the language change to propagate (I think at least 2 years), and we also need to ensure that the back-end removes the extra code added for 3-clause loops when it turns out to be unnecessary.\n\nAlso, it looks like you are proposing a use for OREDCL in the the 3-clause transformation (\"post-body\"), but I don\u0027t see the whole picture.
