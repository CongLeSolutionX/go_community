Unfortunately, the name-qualifying logic seems to find a collision between cmd/compile/internal/syntax and regexp/syntax when compiling from source, but doesn\u0027t find that collision (and thus qualifies the names differently) when importing from export data.\n\nMoving this call doesn\u0027t fix that problem, but the call doesn\u0027t look right to me.",
