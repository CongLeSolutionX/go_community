      "message": "thanks for your change!\n\nas a high level comment, I\u0027m not a fan of the naming scheme for fixing conflicts with variables already named min or max. the code seems harder for me to read, especially when _min or _max end up on the same line as min or max.\n\nwe could refactor that code so that there wasn\u0027t a conflict, but I don\u0027t think switching to min/max is worth the refactoring cost (and the potential to introduce new bugs because it\u0027s additional code churn).\n\nif we were rewriting this code or writing it from scratch, I would definitely use min/max more. but as it stands I\u0027m not sure the benefits are worth the costs in this part of the codebase, where the bugs tend to be very subtle. therefore, I would prefer if we just left all those cases where we have a conflict alone.",
