      "message": "Yes, I intend this to ignore setitimer signals if the M has its own timer via timer_create.\n\nIn the context of PS4, I believe I know one way it would happen and I suspect another.\n\nFirst, per-thread profiling starts (in PS4) inside runtime·execute. An M can run a G for several milliseconds at a time, and so may be in the middle of running a G when another goroutine asks to enable profiling. (There may be dozens of Ms like this, using tens of milliseconds of CPU in total.) Until the M stops running that goroutine, it won\u0027t have a per-thread timer because it hasn\u0027t yet called runtime·execute (in PS4). Until then, the only timer tracking its CPU spend is the process-wide setitimer, and I think it\u0027s right for the profiler to record any SIGPROF delivered to that thread that arrives before the thread calls timer_create.\n\nThe other is cgo, or threads that are in the process but not completely known to the Go runtime. I\u0027m not sure what the details of this one look like. Do threads in the process that aren\u0027t-quite-known to the Go runtime run this same signal handler code? I suppose this must be only for somewhat-known-to-Go threads, since getg().m doesn\u0027t panic/fault. But again, what\u0027s on my mind is threads that are busy for a while and miss the cue to call timer_create.\n\nAnd, if there is to be a way to control whether the program uses timer_create (I set up a new GODEBUG flag for my own convenience, but maybe it stays?), then this is a way to allow either mechanism to work.\n\nWhat do you think about those cases and how to address them?",
