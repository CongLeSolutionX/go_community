      "message": "Hello, this change would be best discussed in two separate GitHub issues (one for the ordering, one for grease) before jumping ahead to implementation.\n\nFor ordering, it sounds like you might be putting TLS 1.3 ciphersuites in Config.CipherSuites. This is not supported, and TLS 1.3 cipher suites are a separate set from TLS 1.2 ones, so their relative order does not matter.\n\nFor grease, we might consider implementing it, but if we do we\u0027re unlikely to expose a Config option.",
