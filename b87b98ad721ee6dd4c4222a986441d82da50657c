      "message": "Yep understood. I mean that I lost interest in contributing due to the long delay here -- opening the PR in Jul 2018 and receiving reviews in Nob 2019. I was reminded of this PR in May of last year when the wait-author tag was added, and decided to finally come back and officially \"Abandon\" this.\n\nI don\u0027t think I\u0027ll revisit this PR. Maybe somebody can take it up, maybe someday I\u0027ll revisit. For now, I have no interest. The bug still exists but I don\u0027t reuse request bodies often and I know how to work around it if I do.",

      "message": "I think we already have too many of these special wrapper error types, and given the new error stuff in Go 1.13, we should probably be doing things that way (https://golang.org/doc/go1.13#error_wrapping, https://blog.golang.org/go1.13-errors) nowadays.\n\nBut I think we could make all this code a bunch simpler by just defining a closeBunc func somewhere, like:\n\n     closeBody func() error\n\n(probably on Request?)\n\nAnd initializing it like:\n\n   var once sync.Once\n   var bodyCloseErr error\n   req.closeFunc \u003d func() error {\n        once.Do(func() {\n             bodyCloseErr \u003d req.Body.Close()\n        })\n        return bodyCloseErr\n   }\n\nAnd then net/http should never call Request.Body.Close() itself, but only calling closeBody(), which will handle duplicate suppression.\n\nSeems like that\u0027d simplify a bunch of these CLs?",
