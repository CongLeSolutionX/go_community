      "message": "Is there any other floating point in the runtime? I am not convinced we want to depend on floating point here if not. It\u0027s nice during bootstrapping not to need floating point to be correct just to run a GC.\n\nEven if there is some other floating point, this is so easy to get rid of, it seems worth doing. Since triggerratio is only used in one place, you can just write *7/8 there.",

That will be much harder to replace with integer math.",
