      "message": "I don’t think this is accurate or necessary. I don’t think you can asset that the ticker will wait for one d duration, the time the ticker took may exceed that time, and the time it takes to react to the tick, that is the program process enough instructions to observe the tick may exceed d by an unbounded amount, so I’m wary of implied guarantees like “once”. \n\ncan I ask, what is the downside of the ticker firing immediately? that seems to be the underlying cause of this issue.",

      "message": "You\u0027re right, obviously, but at the same time I don\u0027t think we should\nadd that level of detail here; so I tried to find the simplest way to\nsay \"expect the 1st tick around the time d elapses the first time, and\nnot to fire at time 0\". All the other caveats around the ticks\ntimings are documented anyway in other places on this page.\n\n\u003e can I ask, what is the downside of the ticker firing immediately?\n\u003e that seems to be the underlying cause of this issue.\n\nNot sure, but it was rejected in the past:\n\nhttps://github.com/golang/go/issues/17601\n\nIt seems the rationale was \"we can\u0027t change the existing behaviour\nwithout breaking users, and it\u0027s not important enough to justify a new\nTicker type\".",
