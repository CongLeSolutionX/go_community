You find the thing you\u0027re looking for doing a bunch of runs of the form\n\ngo doc foo\n\nand then when you find the right one, you want to see how to use it, so you do\n\ngo doc -ex fooIWant\n\nIn other words, when you run with this flag, is it likely you\u0027ve already seen the other documentation?\n\nGenuinely a question. It\u0027s of course unknown without experience.",
