      "message": "This should describe the intended meaning of this condition rather than the exact builders on which it works.\n\nBut also I think this is reversed.  I think this will be easier to understand if it is parallel to the existing [short] condition: a condition that is true when not running slow tests.  [short] is pretty much always used as\n    [short] skip\nand the same will be true here.  So perhaps\n    [slowsystem] skip\nand something like\n- [slowsystem] for whether we are running on a system that is not considered fast",

      "message": "I wasn\u0027t exactly sure how to express that condition, both in the name, and in the documentation here. The tests that call isSlow are tests that are important enough that we always run them on (some) builders, but not important enough that we always run them in -short mode. The closest I can get to is \"whether to run some slow tests, even in -short mode\", but then it\u0027s a bit vague about which tests those \"some slow tests\" are.\n\nFurther, the condition doesn\u0027t really make sense without the concept of short, which is why I wanted to combine them with the short condition, as in:\n\n   [short] [!runslow] skip\n\nI\u0027m not quite sure how to name the reverse condition: slowsystem seems off to me because a non-builder workstation, which is likely faster than the builders, would have slowsystem set. We could have:\n\n   [short] [slowsystem] skip\n\nDo you think it\u0027s clearer to have a positive condition like [slowsystem] in the condition in the conjunction instead of [!runslow]? If so, what do you think of [skipslow] instead of [slowsystem]?\n\nBy the way, here\u0027s another option that adds a  [builder] verb, but I think that\u0027s even worse...",
