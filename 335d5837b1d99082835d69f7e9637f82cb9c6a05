      "message": "I don\u0027t think we need this flag.  I think this problem is only interesting for Go code linked into non-Go programs.  In that case, the Go runtime only installs signal handlers for signals with the _SigPanic flag (see sigInstallGoHandler in signal1_unix.go).  So I think we can change any uses of _SigFatalDFL in this CL to check _SigPanic instead.",

It may be that that does not work today (in order to see it you\u0027ll need to use cgo to start a C thread that then crashes), but at least at first glance that is how I think it ought to work (https://golang.org/cl/17761 is relevant here).",

By definition a synchronous signal will recur if execution continues at the same place.  The default behavior for such a signal can never be to simply continue executing.",
