I\u0027m not 100% sure I\u0027m properly switching between go versions when I build. I plan to do more research when I can to try to figure out what\u0027s going on, and I will post my test code and results here when I can. (Since I suspect my mistakes may be obvious to a seasoned go developer...)",
