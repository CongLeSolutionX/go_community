      "message": "I think it may be worth doing a direct performance comparison for this change using golang.org/x/benchmarks.\n\nI looked over our performance dashboard (perf.golang.org/dashboard). There isn\u0027t a great way to get a summary of the impact of a particular CL right now, but you can sort of scroll through and look.\n\nOverall, it looks like a 0.5â€“1.5 percentage point improvement in total binary size. The impact on text is much larger, but is somewhat offset by a large pclntab (since there are more SP adjustments, this makes sense).\n\nThe performance results are pretty mixed. There are a bunch of small speedups and a bunch of small slowdowns. But there are some huge speedups (25 percentage point improvement on BaseTest2KB-8) and some pretty big slowdowns (10 percentage point slowdown on BucketsEqual/same_20_values-8). As usual, microbenchmarks aren\u0027t necessarily representative of anything, so I wouldn\u0027t read too much into those specific results, but it does suggest a real performance comparison is warranted here.",
