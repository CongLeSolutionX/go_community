### New structs package

Go 1.23 adds a new package for special struct field
types that modify structure properties.

In this release, the only such type is `HostLayout`
which indicates that a structure with a field of that
type has a layout that conforms to host platform
expectations.  This currently only affects wasm32,
where 64-bit integer and float types passed to the
host platform must be aligned on a 64-bit boundary.
