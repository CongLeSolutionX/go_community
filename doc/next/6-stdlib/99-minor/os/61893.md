On Windows, the [`os.Lstat`](/os#Lstat) function no longer sets the
[`os.ModeSymlink`](/os#ModeSymlink) type mode bit for mount points.
This behavior is controlled by the `winsymlink` setting.
For Go 1.23, it defaults to `winsymlink=1`.
Previous versions default to `winsymlink=0`.

On Windows, the [`os.Lstat`](/os#Lstat) and [`os.Stat`](/os#Stat) functions
now set the [`os.ModeIrregular`](/os#ModeIrregular) type mode bit for all
reparse files except for those that are explicitly supported by the
[`os`](/os) package. As of Go 1.23, the [`os`](/os) package supports
symbolic links, unix domain sockets, and files managed by the
data deduplication service.
This behavior is controlled by the `winsymlink` setting.
For Go 1.23, it defaults to `winsymlink=1`.
