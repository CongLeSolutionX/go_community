The [WithDataIndependentTiming] function allows the user to run a function
with architecture specific features enabled which guarantee specific instructions
are data value timing invariant. This can be used to make sure that code designed
to run in constant time is not optimized by CPU-level features such that it
operates in variable time. Currently on Arm64, [WithDataIndependentTiming] uses the PSTATE.DIT bit, and on all other architectures is a no-op.
