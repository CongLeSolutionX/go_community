The [WithDataIndependentTiming] function allows the user to run a function with
architecture specific features enabled which guarantee specific instructions are
data value timing invariant. This can be used to make sure that code designed to
run in constant time is not optimized by CPU-level features such that it
operates in variable time. Currently on arm64, [WithDataIndependentTiming] uses
the PSTATE.DIT bit, and on all other architectures is a no-op.
