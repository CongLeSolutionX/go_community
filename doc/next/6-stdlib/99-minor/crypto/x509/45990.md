[`CreateCertificateRequest`](/pkg/crypto/x509#CreateCertificateRequest) now correct supports RSA-PSS signature algorithms.

[`CreateCertificateRequest`](/pkg/crypto/x509#CreateCertificateRequest) and [`CreateRevocationList`](/pkg/crypto/x509#CreateRevocationList) now verify the generated signature using the signerâ€™s public key. If the signature is invalid, an error is returned. This has been the behavior of [`CreateCertificate`](/pkg/crypto/x509#CreateCertificate) since Go 1.16.
