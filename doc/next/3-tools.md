### Go command {#go-command}

Setting the `GOROOT_FINAL` environment variable no longer has an effect
([#62047](https://go.dev/issue/62047)).
Distributions that install the `go` command to a location other than
`$GOROOT/bin/go` should install a symlink instead of relocating
or copying the `go` binary.

The new go env `-changed` flag causes the command to print only
those settings whose effective value differs from the default value
that would be obtained in an empty environment with no prior uses of the `-w` flag.

### Cgo {#cgo}
