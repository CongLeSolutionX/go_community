Files in this directory tree that end in .md are release note fragments.
They will be merged into a single file as part of a release.

The files are merged by being concatenated in sorted order by pathname. Files in
the directory matching the glob "*stdlib/*minor" are treated specially. They should
be in subdirectories corresponding to standard library package paths, and headings
for those package paths will be generated automatically.

Files in api/next must have corresponding files in *stdlib/*minor. The files should
be in the subdirectory for the package with the new API, and should be named after
the issue number of the API proposal. For example, for an api/next file with the
line

    pkg net/http, function F #12345

there should be a file named net/http/12345.md. That file should contain either a
full sentence or a TODO, ideally referring to a person with the responsibility to
complete the note.
