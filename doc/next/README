Files in this directory that end in .md are release note fragments.
They will be merged into a single file as part of a release.

main.md contains the outline for the final document.
Other fragments must specify where they belong in main.md by starting
with one of its headings (but see the exception for API fragments below).

A fragment file can contain more than one heading. Headings that do
not need to match existing ones should have their text begin with '+':

    # This heading must match

    # +This one need not

Headings should appear in the same order as they do in the main document.

The contents following each heading must contain either the string "TODO" or a
full sentence. Ideally, the TODO will refer to a person with the responsibility
to complete the note.

Files of the form NNNNN.md must correspond to NNNNN.txt files in api/next,
and vice versa.
(That is, every API change must be accompanied by a release note fragment.)
If a NNNNN.md file does not begin with a heading, "Minor changes to the library"
is assumed.
