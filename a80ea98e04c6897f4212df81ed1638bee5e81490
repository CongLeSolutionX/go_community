      "message": "While working on playground code that uses this patch I came to some complexity b/c I want to hide these artificial delays of 1ns for each write. For some reason I do not like that every operation of write ends up having 1ns delay exposed in Events slice to the user of /compile. I have achieved some success, but I am not sure if this is good enough. So my thinking, is there a way to make this easier for playground code to reverse 1ns addition to every write call? What if we hold a counter of write calls which we add to fake time on every write call?\n\nWhile writing this, I realised I need to share the code I am talking about.\n\nhttps://go-review.googlesource.com/#/c/playground/+/105496",
