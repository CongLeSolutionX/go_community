      "message": "Sort of.  My intent was that codegenArg is really a flag to cmd/internal/obj/... and so really should be passed to both ?g and asm.  But 5g doesn\u0027t take -shared so when David (iirc) added support for linux/arm c-shared he switch this around so that codegenArg was only passed to asm. But that\u0027s not what I need for shared, so i switched it back. Really either 5g should take -shared or cmd/asm should not need it on arm, but I ran out of energy to figure this out properly.",
