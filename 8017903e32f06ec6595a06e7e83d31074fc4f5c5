On the other hand, the amount of allocations concerns me. I\u0027ve submitted the CL 629935 tackling some low hanging fruits, reducing the allocations by half. Feel free to pull in those changes in your CL.",

      "message": "I\u0027m running the `BenchmarkRemoveAll` test from the `os` repo. For the moment I only investigated the allocations. I did take a cpu profile and saw that 95% of the time was spent on cgo calls, the Root logic didn\u0027t show up in the profile. The top ofender was `NtSetInformationFile`, followed by `CloseHandle` and `NtOpenFile`, all from `windows.Deleteat`. I don\u0027t understand why is that doing 3 syscalls instead of 1 (`DeleteFileW`) reduces the performance by 500%. I\u0027m probably missing something, as our `Deleteat` implementation seems almost identical to `DeleteFileW`.\n\n\u003e I think this is an argument for not trying to change RemoveAll until Root has a faster path for listing directory contents.
