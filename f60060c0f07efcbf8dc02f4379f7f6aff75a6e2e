      "message": "Ah, here\u0027s the trouble with the TryBots, I think: the version of the `testing` package with the `init` function should appear as a test variant of the package when using `go list -test`, but instead it\u0027s taking the place of the non-test `testing` package when the command is `go test`.\n\nTo keep `go list` working properly, I think the test and non-test variants of the `testing` package need to be treated as essentially two distinct packages.",

      "message": "It makes sense that I need to adjust `go test -list` to fix the TryBot error. I\u0027m not sure I follow everything you\u0027re saying, though. Are you implying that the change to \u0027go list\u0027 would be *instead* of this mechanism whereby we alter the testing package under \u0027go test\u0027?\n\nDo you know whether that also explains the failure I was seeing locally as well in https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/184923/2#message-b658c300697ed7708d2f79e28c0ecf593632d6ec? I don\u0027t see how that error could happen as a result of \u0027go list\u0027 behavior.",
