      "message": "Spoke with Egon briefly about this, and it seems like the defer is more costly than expected due to the unpack function (along with the inlined searchInts) having a bounds check, and the defer also becoming a closure for some reason.\n\nI hope that we could improve the compiler here, but this 4% might be enough to warrant merging this change with a TODO, akin to how searchInts inlines sort.Search with a TODO.",
