      "message": "Hmmm, this is really bizarre. I don\u0027t think we want to change how the assembler frontend parses constants. I don\u0027t think we expect user to write such instructions by hand. Maybe print a warning and move on.\n\nIf these instructions are actually useful in user assembly code, maybe we should introduce a different syntax for them.\n",

      "message": "I did this change has two reasons.\n1. According to ARM architecture reference manual, the instruction \"MOVK $0, Rd\" and \"MOVK $(0\u003c\u003c16), Rd\" have different operational semantics. So encoding them as the same binary is incorrect.\n2. The inconsistency of assembler and disassembler.\n  e.g. 1700a0f2, the disassmbler decodes it as \"MOVK $(0\u003c\u003c16), R23\", but assembler encodes it as 170080f2.\n\nAnd maybe we canâ€™t force users not to write these instructions by hand.\nThank you.",
