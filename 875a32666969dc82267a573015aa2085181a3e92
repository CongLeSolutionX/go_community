      "message": "My main use for logging in the past is seeing the exactly number of times a rewrite rule triggers. That helps me see the impact as I adjust the rule to try to cover more cases.\n\nHow about instead we record counts (map[string]int) and then flush the accumulated log data at the end of every rewrite pass? The flush would be a no-op when logging isn\u0027t enabled--maybe controlled by a global var written in the generated code. The flushed data could still be line oriented for easy command line processing, e.g. \"rulefile:ruleline count\" or some such. (Maybe even \"path/to/pkg.funcname rulefile:ruleline count\"?) The consumer of these log files could then discard the counts or sum them as desired.",
