      "message": "\u003e are there any potential issues there (e.g. program using x/text tip with go tip)?\n\nJust finished testing w/ the most recent version (via GH) of x/text; no news is good news. The only issue I can really imagine is inconsistencies in data availability, i.e. info for a Unicode 14 or 15 rune is available in src/unicode but the rune name won\u0027t be available in x/text/unicode/runenames.\n\nI would love to update x/text as well to get the whole project to parity w/ modern text standards, but the generate sequence appears to be borked (hence no accompanying PR). Seems pretty important that this gets fixed; Unicode is over a year out of date and the CLDR is about 5 years out of date, but both of these should only take a few minutes to upgrade. I would be more than happy to be involved in seeing this through if anyone more qualified would be interested.",
