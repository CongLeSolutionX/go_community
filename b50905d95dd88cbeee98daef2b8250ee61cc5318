I think you are delaying typechecking variable declarations to avoid some bad side effect of typechecking too early?\n\nAlso, not sure I\u0027m following, but it seems like constdecls and typedecls are no longer on typecheck.Target.Decls anymore?  If so, would it be better to keep things consistent for now between -G\u003d3 and not?",
