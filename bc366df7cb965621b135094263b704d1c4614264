On systems that support internal linking with -buildmode\u003dpie, like amd64 GNU/Linux, the internal test ought to work even with CGO_ENABLED\u003d0.  For testing purposes, I think this is OK, but we should probably add a comment:\n\n// We don\u0027t want to test -linkmode\u003dexternal if cgo is not supported.\n// On some systems -buildmode\u003dpie implies -linkmode\u003dexternal, so just\n// always skip the test if cgo is not supported.",
