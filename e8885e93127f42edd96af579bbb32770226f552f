      "message": "Instead of always making a copy (even when we\u0027re going to throw it away at line 805 if this didn\u0027t produce a crasher), let\u0027s instead only make a copy if we need to.\n\nSo for example, this could be added at line 801\n  switch c :\u003d candidate.(type) {\n  case []byte:\n        // c could change later while we continue to minimize, so\n\t// make a copy since we\u0027ll be keeping this candidate around.\n\tvals[valI] \u003d append([]byte{}, c...)\n  }\n  \nHowever, we\u0027ll also need to adjust that around a bit when you rebase this after some recent changes to this code. If you\u0027re willing to rebase it, then I can give you the code snippet I had in mind.",
