      "message": "For my future reference: This is a modified version of the test from https://go.dev/cl/25330, and the rest of this CL also applies Unix-only changes to the Windows side.\n\nIt might be nice to unify the Unix and Windows tests here, but I suspect the details are different enough to make it difficult.\n\nI\u0027m also not certain that this test is really necessary; I think the code path involved is perhaps sufficiently exercised by existing tests. But perhaps not, so adding the test as-is seems okay to me.",
