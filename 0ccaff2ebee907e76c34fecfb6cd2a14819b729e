      "message": "We shouldn\u0027t add a new top-level flag for this. It would be much better to put it in the debugtab at the top so it hangs off the existing -d flag. That currently doesn\u0027t accept strings, but I would argue that you\u0027re overloading this anyway with the special \"pctoinline\" value. Instead, I would say leave the existing PC-value table debugging code as is (we can improve that separately if desired) and make a separate int-typed debug flag to enable dumping of the inline tree.",

      "message": "The -pcln flag can take pctospadj, pctofile, pctoline, or pctoinline as an argument.  We could even let -pcln take multiple tables as arguments: -pcln pctofile,pctoline.  I suppose we could get the same functionality with -d, but that would require more code and globals.  What\u0027s the downside of adding another flag?",
