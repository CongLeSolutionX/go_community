      "message": "Hey there Matthew 👋 This is a draft CL to get a start on #62407.\n\nIt\u0027s my first time trying to mess with the compiler, so unfortunately I got kinda stuck and felt silly, hoping you could provide a couple of hints. \n\n- The optimization here is that we should concatenate the strings and have the compiler return the string\u0027s data directly, right?\n- Is this the correct place to add the condition?\n- Is it right to walk the OADDSTR node and try to access the results of the OCALLFUNC, or should we reach into its List individually?\n\nThanks in advance for your time and encouragement!",
