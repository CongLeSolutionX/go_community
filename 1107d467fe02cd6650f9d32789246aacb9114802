      "message": "I\u0027m skeptical that this wrapper can possibly work. The assembly is doing things like trying to unwind its own stack frame. Extra stack frames seem like they would break that.\n\nIf the linkname must match, then you don\u0027t need a wrapper. Just change the assembly to say xx_cgo_panicmem instead of ·panicmem. (That is, change the name and drop the center dot.)",

      "message": "I misunderstood what \"linkname must match\" means. The equivalent of this code would be to make the assembly say ·xx_cgo_panicmem, with a center dot. But I assume you tried that. Why doesn\u0027t that work?\n\nAlso note that runtime/cgo exports crosscall2 (defined in assembly) from callbacks.go, so something like this should be possible. Maybe just copy what that does?",
