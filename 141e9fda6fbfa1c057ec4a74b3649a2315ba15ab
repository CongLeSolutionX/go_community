      "message": "Why is the unit optional?\n\nsuch a design usually lead to the error that users need to assume an unit (bytes) and might get it wrong (OS pages) or assume it is some factor (e.g. percentage like in GOGC). \n\nAnother problem is that one can accidentally assume this will always be numeric only and then suddenly someone is using GiB on it.\n\nSo can that part be re-considered?",
