      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that this makes it entirely clear that this is *different* than the docs on the io.WriterTo interface. Here we\u0027re saying that we might make multiple calls to the underlying Reader, ie. the buffer may be filled multiple times (which is what resulted in an unexpected blocking net.Conn read for me when I thought I was just flushing a buffer). Maybe it\u0027s fine; would be curious if others think this is clear.",

      "message": "Thanks; your version is more or less a slight rewording of what it already says, no? \"writes all available data to w, stopping only when there is no more data to write\" vs \"writes data to w until there\u0027s no more data to write\". The \"all available\" specifically confused me; if I have a bufio.Reader, \"all available\" data sounds like \"what\u0027s already in the buffer\", so I\u0027d still think we want some clarification that it might call read (that\u0027s why it was a \"may perform\", but maybe \"may or may not\" to ensure that people interpret it correctly?",
