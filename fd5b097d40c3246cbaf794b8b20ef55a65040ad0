      "message": "I\u0027d probably skip this, and just emit a second error for the test case. We emit two errors for\n\n    func f(i interface{}) {\n\tx, ok :\u003d *i\n    }\n\nso I think it\u0027s consistent to report two for \"x, ok :\u003d i.(type)\".\n\nThough it looks like -G\u003d3 reports only one error in both cases, so maybe we\u0027ll want to revisit this in a followup CL. For now, I\u0027d just add this to the list of exceptions in test/run.go if it causes you any problems.",
