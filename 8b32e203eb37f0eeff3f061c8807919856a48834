      "message": "actually that part is incorrect because, for example, MSG_TRUNC is never set on any packet, it\u0027s generated in host reception process. hm, \"the platform-dependent flags like syscall.MSG_TRUNC\" is better and clear?",

      "message": "That doesn\u0027t resolve the ambiguity.  There are two separate set of flags here: the flags passed to the recvmsg system call, and the flags in the msg_flags field of the msghdr returned by recvmsg.  The original \"the flags that were set on the packet\" is clear as to which flags are being returned.  Saying \"the platform-dependent flags\" is not clear about that.",
