      "message": "I agree we should fix both cases as well; this seemed like an easy win in the meantime while we discussed the longer term solution.\n\nMy understanding is it is to make sure the `{\"Action\":\"start\"}` are printed in order. I don\u0027t know why we need that, though -- seems reasonable to allow them out of order. That being said the `print` action is ordered so maybe that is the motivation.\n\nIf we do really want to keep it, I think we can do it efficiently, we would just need a new explicit \"Start\" action that tests can depend on instead of this implicit dependency that isn\u0027t handled buy the actiongraph. But that seems like a lot of work if we do not actually need to sequence them.\n\nI am open to either approach or alternatives, let me know which is preferred",

      "message": "The start events are ordered because that\u0027s the only way a consumer of the JSON output can reconstruct the order that packages were passed to the go tool itself. This is valuable when presenting test results to a user, especially across multiple runs (like in a CI system).\n\nFor some context, this originally came out of work I was doing in dist to do a streaming conversion of the JSON test output back to the text format. There was no way to make this deterministic and to match the package sequence of the text format without these ordered start events.\n\nI agree that blocking workers is certainly an unfortunate (and unintended!) consequence and we should find some other way to implement this.\n\nFWIW, I had a similar problem in dist in one of the many rewrites I was doing it to. I wound up adding a separate buffer sequencing layer that understood the first line of each buffer had to be released to the output stream in order, and the lines within any buffer had to be released in order, but that otherwise lines could be released immediately. That resulted in potentially unbounded buffering, but didn\u0027t require anything to block.",

Why can\u0027t the start event both mean that the test started and be released to stdout in package order?\n\nI don\u0027t think this is impossible hypothetically, but referring to my idea above to solve it by introducing a new standalone Start action; the problem with that would be we may execute the Start and the Run action very far apart.\n\nAn alternative approach like buffering would likely solve that.\n\n--\n\nI worked a bit on a prototype. Instead of blocking on `r.prev`, I had text2json buffer up write events while r.prev is open; on exit it flushes out events. This fixes the blocking but doesn\u0027t fully retain the ordering, since we flush the events when the action is complete. It seems like to solve this we would need a global buffer, not a per-action one. This adds up to quite a bit of complexity.\n\nGiven the original intent was just to be able to order the events from the JSON output, do we really need this to be \"Start\"? Can we just print out all the packages at the start with some `Processed` action type or something?",
