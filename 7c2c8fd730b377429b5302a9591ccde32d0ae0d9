      "message": "I agree we should fix both cases as well; this seemed like an easy win in the meantime while we discussed the longer term solution.\n\nMy understanding is it is to make sure the `{\"Action\":\"start\"}` are printed in order. I don\u0027t know why we need that, though -- seems reasonable to allow them out of order. That being said the `print` action is ordered so maybe that is the motivation.\n\nIf we do really want to keep it, I think we can do it efficiently, we would just need a new explicit \"Start\" action that tests can depend on instead of this implicit dependency that isn\u0027t handled buy the actiongraph. But that seems like a lot of work if we do not actually need to sequence them.\n\nI am open to either approach or alternatives, let me know which is preferred",
