      "message": "There can be more than one search suffix in resolv.conf.  I don\u0027t think we want to mix A RRs for foo.search1 and AAAA RRs for foo.search2.  I think instead of a bool, we should return an int of how many tryOneName attempts were made, and then we collect records from the fewest attempts.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s technically a race that /etc/resolv.conf might change between calling lookup(name, dnsTypeA) and lookup(name, dnsTypeAAAA), which could change the suffix list.  So I think lookup() needs to be refactored (e.g., extract a lookupConfig method) so that goLookupIPOrder() can provide the same dnsConfig value to both calls.",
