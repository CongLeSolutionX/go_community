      "message": "I think we want a req.closeBody() call before we reassign the req, just in case the other RoundTripper didn\u0027t.\n\nAnd looking at the http2.Transport, I don\u0027t see where it does?\n\nI\u0027m more concerned about missing closes than I am about double closes. Double closes are kinda okay and I have a plan for how to address them all at once in a future release (basically adding a sync.Once-like atomic unexported field to net/http.Request, and making body closes go through a helper CAS method) .",
