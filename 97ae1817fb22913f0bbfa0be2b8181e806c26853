      "message": "@Ian, Damien, Dmitri: thank you for the reviews!\n\nDo you think this simple fix preventing `GODEBUG\u003dmultipathtcp\u003dX` to work in some cases could be considered for backport to the \u003e\u003d v1.21 versions?\n\nThe code that is being modified has not changed for at least 5-6 years, the cherry-pick should not be an issue.\nOn these older versions, MPTCP is not used by default, except if `GODEBUG\u003dmultipathtcp\u003d1` is set, so the risk should be limited.\nWDYT?",
