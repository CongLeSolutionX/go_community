      "message": "For a lay audience, I suspect this is a bit scary and unclear. What about something like:\n\nEarly data (also called \"0-RTT mode\") is not currently supported as a client or server. Additionally, a Go 1.12 server does not support skipping unexpected early data if a client sends it. Since TLS 1.3 0-RTT mode involves clients keeping state regarding which servers support 0-RTT, a Go 1.12 server thus cannot be part of a load-balancing pool where some other servers do support 0-RTT. If switching a domain from a server that supported 0-RTT to a Go 1.12 server, 0-RTT would have to be disabled for at least the lifetime of the issued session tickets before the switch to ensure uninterrupted operation.",
