      "message": "Thank you, but please leave this code alone:\n\n1) The TODO(agl) is not referring to the fact that we have an extra q value here, it refers to the fact that (ideally) divWVW doesn\u0027t even have to store (record) the q value at all. But that would be a more significant change, quite possibly requiring a different divWVW implementation. In short, this comment is relevant, so don\u0027t remove it.\n\n2) As your benchmarks show, not calling q.make doesn\u0027t make a difference. But with your change you have duplicated an implementation detail of nat.make to this code (the + 4). Now, if somebody is improving nat.make, this code won\u0027t benefit unless we keep track of it separately. Let\u0027s not do that.",
