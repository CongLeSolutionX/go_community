Until you do, I insist we restore original version\n\ns/SecurityMaxSidSize/256/\n\nI think 256 is nice and round number, and it does not need introduction of const and a comment pointing to some Internet groups thread. I don\u0027t see why 184 is better than 256 here.",

I don\u0027t know anything about new all\u003d-d\u003dcheckptr checker, but I don\u0027t see your how your change can make this code more correct.\n\nI just submitted CL 203442 which replaced [:x] slice operation with [:x:x]. Perhaps you want to do the same. But I don\u0027t really know.\n\nAnd unlike CL 203442, the memory you are referring lives outside of Go memory. ConvertSidToStringSid returns memory explicitly allocated by Windows. I am not sure, if it makes any difference here.\n\n\u003e Can you help testing this function with all\u003d-d\u003dcheckptr? \n\nSure. How do I test it?",
