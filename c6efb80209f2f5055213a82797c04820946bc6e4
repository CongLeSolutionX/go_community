Until you do, I insist we restore original version\n\ns/SecurityMaxSidSize/256/\n\nI think 256 is nice and round number, and it does not need introduction of const and a comment pointing to some Internet groups thread. I don\u0027t see why 184 is better than 256 here.",

Can you help testing this function with all\u003d-d\u003dcheckptr? If 256 is ok for the compiler, I will restore it and leave it for other Windows experts to take a look.",
