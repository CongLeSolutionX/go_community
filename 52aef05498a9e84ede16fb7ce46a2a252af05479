      "message": "\u003e Or are you objecting to the use of \u0027parse\u0027, since this is in the AST package.\n\nMostly. I think we should document this so it makes sense w.r.t the \"go/ast\" package. Not what the post-condition of \"go/parser\"\u0027s ParseFile is. This is also a correct comment for the pre-condition of ast.NewPackage, which also does some resolution.\n\nThis comment is not really correct for the main user of the Obj field, \"go/parser\"\u0027s resolver type. nil is a valid state for the \"go/parser\" package and the parser will resolve the identifier when possible up to the given scope.\n\nAs for a suggestion, I think this should either be reverted or something like:\n\n\tIdent struct {\n\t\tNamePos token.Pos // identifier position\n\t\tName    string    // identifier name\n\t\t// Obj is the denoted object; or nil if the identifier is unresolved.\n\t\t// If this identifier is unresolved after object resolution,\n\t\t// it does not refer to an object in this File.\n\t\tObj     *Object\n\t}\n\nThis is quite the mouthful. But I think this is closer to the goal.\n\nOne way of viewing this is that we are arguably swimming upstream here because we are trying to expand on the documentation of parser.ParseFile when SkipObjectResolution is not set:\n\nhttps://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/release-branch.go1.17:src/go/parser/interface.go;l\u003d71-74\n\n// The mode parameter controls the amount of source text parsed and other\n// optional parser functionality. If the SkipObjectResolution mode bit is set,\n// the object resolution phase of parsing will be skipped, causing File.Scope,\n// File.Unresolved, and all Ident.Obj fields to be nil.",

I agree.\n\n\u003e If this identifier is unresolved after object resolution, it does not refer to an object in this File.\n\nI think that\u0027s accurate, with some exceptions that we probably don\u0027t want to enumerate (such as selectors). However, it _is_ a mouthful, and is an incomplete description of how Obj behaves: the nilness of Obj also depends on whether it has been resolved in a package via ast.NewPackage, and whether or not the SkipObjectResolution mode was used during parsing, though again we shouldn\u0027t mention parsing explicitly. On that note, mentioning object resolution is also coupling the documentation to the behavior of the parser package.\n\nI think the original documentation was about as good as we can do without being misleading in some way: if Obj is non nil then it should point to the denoted object. If Obj is nil, then this denoted object was not resolved, or has not yet been resolved.\n\nI vote for just reverting. The original documentation, while brief, was not misleading.",
