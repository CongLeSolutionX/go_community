Major Differences from TLS 1.2:\n+       //\n+       // \u003e TLS 1.3 removed point format negotiation in favor of a single point\n+       // format for each curve.\n+       //\n+       // Thus, default to true for supportsPointFormat (whether the peer supports\n+       // the uncompressed format) when the extension is elided as well.\n+       //\n+       // During clientHelloMsg.unmarshal(...), we\u0027ve already checked that the\n+       // extension, if present, is non-empty, so this len(...) call is equivalent\n+       // to semantics saying the extension was not provided.",
