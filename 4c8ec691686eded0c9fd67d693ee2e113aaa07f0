I imagine we\u0027ll want to continue accepting UTF-8 characters as we did before, and spaces.\n\nFor example, you can copy/paste this into your URL bar, but this function would reject it:\n\n   https://www.google.com/search?q\u003dФотки собак\u0026source\u003dlnms\n\nAnd I think it\u0027s valid in an \u003ca href\u003d\"...\"\u003e attribute too, so users will likely encounter such values.\n\nAnd net/http converts it to %xx encoded upon sending, I thought.\n\nI\u0027d leave a comment about how, for historical purposes, we accept more than Section 3.4 permits, and only strip out invalid ASCII (CTLs, newlines, tab), but accept space.",
