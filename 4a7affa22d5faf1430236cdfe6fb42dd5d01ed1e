I considered holding the handshake lock around it but that\u0027s also insufficient since a renegotiation can occur after the function is called but before the EKM is used. This is generally not an issue (renegotiation disabled by default in \"crypto/tls\", HTTP/2 treats renegotiation as a connection error) so it might be sufficient to solve this with documentation.",
