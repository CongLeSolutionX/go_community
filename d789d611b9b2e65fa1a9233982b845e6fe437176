      "message": "I haven\u0027t fully grokked these CLs, but this seems to contradict the above note: \"Command and LookPath no longer allow results from a PATH search to be found relative to the current directory.\"\n\nIn the current code, it appears that Command/LookPath _do_ still return relative results in the current directory, unless NoDefaultCurrentDirectoryInExePath is set.\n\nPerhaps the confusion here is that the LookPath change above only applies to paths that are _explicitly_ in PATH, while here . is searched _in addition_ to what is in PATH?\n\nI think this could be made more clear (perhaps by clarifying above that . is still included on windows?).",
