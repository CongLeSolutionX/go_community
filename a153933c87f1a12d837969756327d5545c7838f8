      "message": "It might be worth testing that records are returned given that truncation often, but does not always, involve removing all records. As a result, it is possible that some code expects or will expect that no records are returned along with a truncated bit. Since there likely isn\u0027t a viable retry mechanism to get the full response when the truncated bit is set with TCP, a truncated set of records is likely included and would be useful.",
