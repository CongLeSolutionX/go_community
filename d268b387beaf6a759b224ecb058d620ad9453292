In almost all previous cases we\u0027ve enumerated all of the counter names in the code, not synthesized a counter name out of a user-provided value. (The one exception to this would be /gopls/client-other, for which the number of distinct clients should be very small, and for the most part this is provided by the LSP client, not the user directly).",
