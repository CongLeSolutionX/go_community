      "message": "Thanks for the explanation, but this just seems too fragile to me.  If all binaries on AIX are PIE, then if the system loader starts picking a different load address then this test will fail inexplicably.  I think the relocated function below should just always return true on AIX.\n\nIf we want a proper test on AIX, then we should use a different approach in which we check that the entry in the symbol table and the actual runtime value both have the same offset from, e.g., runtime.text.",

      "message": "I do agree with you. I\u0027ll remove this part for this CL and will submit another CL with an AIX test later. \nHowever, I still want to keep the non-cgo test for the moment. With internal linker, .text symbols are at the right address and my programs aren\u0027t PIE (because of read-only relocations). That way I can still check that nm is acting as wanted.",
