      "message": "This CL is adding new exported identifiers. Please document them in the Go 1.17 release notes. I think it would go under new image and image/draw parts of the https://tip.golang.org/doc/go1.17#minor_library_changes section.\n\nOf course, this commit needs to be rebased first, since they\u0027ve been many changes here since the parent commit. Alternatively, it\u0027s okay to do this in a follow up CL, if you prefer, but doing it in the same CL is likely better.",
