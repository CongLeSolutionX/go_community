      "message": "I agree that it\u0027s useful to be able to set an environment variable from a command\u0027s output, but I\u0027m not a fan of the backtick syntax (looks too much like a command in unix shell syntax, but isn\u0027t a general command).\n\nIn general we treat the stdout / stderr buffers as if they were files, so a more shell-like syntax might be something like `env FOO\u003d$(\u003cstdout)` or ``env FOO\u003d`\u003cstdout` ``. But then I\u0027m still a bit wary of introducing a syntax that looks general but only works for a special case.\n\nMaybe we could introduce special variables `$STDOUT` and `$STDERR` that also refer to the buffers? I\u0027m not sure.\n\nFor now, perhaps we can write the test in a way that avoids the need for new script functionality.",
