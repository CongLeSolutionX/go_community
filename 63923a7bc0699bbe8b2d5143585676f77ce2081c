      "message": "Since the compiler is just reserving space for these fields, rather than filling them in (except next), would it be possible to just take the size of the type and write out zeros to pad up to that size? I\u0027m not positive, but that size might be in moduledata.Size before it gets zeroed above.\n\nYou could further simplify this if you moved the next field earlier (maybe put it first?). Then there would be a compiler-filled part followed by a runtime-filled part and the compiler could just zero the runtime-filled part.",
